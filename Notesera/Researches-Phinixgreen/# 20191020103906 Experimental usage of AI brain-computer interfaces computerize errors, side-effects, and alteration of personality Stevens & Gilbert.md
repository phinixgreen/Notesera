\*\*Abstract\*\*

\
The US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is currently funding experimental trials testing in human novel medical brain implants operated by Artificial Intelligence (AI). The purpose of this chapter is to explore some ethical issues related to the experimental use of these invasive AI-controlled brain devices, in particular, deleterious phenomenological effects these devices may have on a patient's personality and/or sense of self (i.e. patients suffering from postoperative self-estrangement despite symptom reductions). The evolution of these devices from open-looped stimulation to closed-loop personalized AI-controlled stimulation raises many safety concerns that may exacerbate these ethical issues. This new AI-controlled approach is unlike previous open-loop methods (i.e. traditional deep brain stimulation); the AI-tailored made frequency stimulation schedule depends on the computational measurement of patients' brain states which fluctuates from patient to patient. Hence no universal safety standard and the potential for computational error resulting in plausible deleterious effects on a patient's personality. The aim of this chapter is to explore how closed-loop stimulation undermines safety standards and results in skewed risk assessments for complex phenomenon such as a patient's personality, but as well autonomy.

\*\*Questions\*\*\
1. What is the difference between Open-Loop and Closed Loop Method in Brain-Computer Interface?\
\> As far as I understand, Deep Brain Stimulation can be open loop that is it gives stimulation at a constant rate. Closed Loop Stimulation takes feedback from the user and adjusts the level of stimulation through Brain-Computer Interfaces.

1\. What is AI BCI?\
\> According to Stevens and Gilbert, AI BCI are novel medical Brain Implants operated by Artificial Intelligence that provide closed loop personalized stimulation to the user. AI powered BCI is used to monitor the feedback of the users Brain and adjust the level of stimulation.
