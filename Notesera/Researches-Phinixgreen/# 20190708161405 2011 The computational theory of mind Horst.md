# Summary of Productivity Argument against the Functionalism

## 1967- Hilary Putnam

-   \"introduced CCTM into philosophy.\"
-   defends a brand of functionalism now called machine functionalism.

He emphasizes probabilistic automata, which are similar to Turing machines except that transitions between computational states are stochastic.

He proposes that mental activity implements a probabilistic automaton and that particular mental states are machine states of the automaton's central processor.

The machine table specifies an appropriate functional organization, and it also specifies the role that individual mental states play within that functional organization.

In this way, Putnam combines functionalism with CCTM.

## 1972- Ned Block and Jerry Fodor

-   \"Machine functionalism faces problem from \... the productivity of thought.
-   A normal human can entertain a potential infinity of propositions.

Machine functionalism identifies mental states with machine states of a probabilistic automaton.

Since there are only finitely many machine states, there are not enough machine states to pair one-one with possible mental states of a normal human.

Of course, an actual human will only ever entertain finitely many propositions.

However, Block and Fodor contend that this limitation reflects limits on lifespan and memory, rather than (say) some psychological law that restricts the class of humanly entertainable propositions.

A probabilistic automaton is endowed with unlimited time and memory capacity yet even still has only finitely many machine states.

Apparently, then, machine functionalism mislocates the finitary limits upon human cognition.\"
