## Definition

> \"Neuroessentialism is the view that the definitive way of explaining human psychological experience is by reference to the brain and its activity from chemical, biological, and neuroscientific perspectives. The underlying assumption of neuroessentialism is that "for all intents and purposes, we are our brains" (Reiner, 2011, p. 161) and "mental processes are either identical with brain processes or exclusively realized by brain processes" (Rowlands, 2010, p. 2).\"

-   Neuroessentialism is the view that we are our brains (Reiner, 2011, p.161) and therefore all our mental processes are identical brain processes realized by the brain only (Rowlands, 2010, p. 2).
