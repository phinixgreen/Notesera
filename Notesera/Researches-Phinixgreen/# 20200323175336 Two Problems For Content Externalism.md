Why Content Externalism is Important for Self Knowledge\
"content externalism would seem to have the consequence that most of our knowledge of our own intentional states is not direct and, like most other kinds of knowledge, must be based on evidence. That is to say, content externalism appears to be prima facie incompatible with privileged first-person access to one's own mind." (Kim, 2011, p.257)\
This implies that without content externality, self-knowledge will not be possible.

Wide Content And Self-Knowlegde\
\* "We believe that a subject has special, direct access to her own mental states.\
\* Perhaps the access is not infallible and does not extend to all mental states, but it is uncontroversial that there is special first-person authority in regard to one's own occurrent thoughts. When you reflect on what you are thinking, you apparently know directly, without further evidence or reasoning, what you think; the content of your thought is immediately and directly accessible to you, and the question of having evidence or doing research does not arise. If you think that the shuttle bus is late and you might miss your flight, you know, in the very act of thinking, that that is what you are thinking. First-person knowledge of the contents of one's own current thoughts is direct and immediate and carries a special sort of authority. (Kim, 2011, p.256)

The Causal-explanatory Efficacy of Wide Content

"The proximate cause of my physical behavior (say, my bodily motions), we feel, must be "local"---it must be a series of neural events originating in my central nervous system that causes the contraction of appropriate muscles, which in turn moves my limbs. This means that what these neural events represent in the outside world is irrelevant to behavior causation: If the same neural events occur in a different environment so that they have different representational (wide) content, they would still cause the same physical behavior. That is, we have reason to think that proximate causes of behavior are locally supervenient on the internal physical states of an organism, but that wide content states are not so supervenient. Hence, the wideness of wide content states is not relevant to causal explanations of physical behavior." (Kim, 2011, 255)

NARROW CONTENT WIDE CONTENT: AND CONTENT EXTERNALISM\
\"Content has a lot to do with what is going on in the world, outside the physical boundaries of the creature.\" (Kim, 2011, 241)

\"It seems, then, that at least in this and other similar cases belief contents are differentiated, or "individuated," by reference to conditions external to the believer.\" (Kim, 2011, 242)

\"Alternatively, we may say that the content of an intentional state is narrow just in case it supervenes on the internal-intrinsic properties of the subject who is in that state, and that it is wide otherwise.\" (Kim, 2011, 242)

This means that the content of intentional state is narrow if it depends solely on the internal subjective states of the subject.

In contrast,

If the content of intentional state does not depend on the internal state of the subjects but on the external environment then it is a wide content (Kim, 2011, 242)

Interpretation Theory (Kim, 2011) Page 228-235\
\"If a native speaker sincerely asserts sentence S (or more broadly, "holds S true," as Donald Davidson says) and S means that there goes a rabbit, then the speaker believes that there goes a rabbit, and in asserting S she expresses her belief that there goes a rabbit.\" (Kim, 2011, p.229)

\"If you knew how to interpret the natives' speech, it would be a simple matter to find out what they believe:\" (Kim, 2011, p.229)

\"There are, then, three variables involved:\
behavior\
belief\
meaning\
Through observation, you have access to one of them, behavior. Your task is to solve for the two unknowns, belief and meaning.\" (Kim, 2011, p.229)\
\"You attribute the content "it is raining" to Karl's belief because you assume that his belief is true.\" (Kim, 2011, p.230)

\"Principle of Charity: Speakers' beliefs are by and large true.\" (Kim, 2011, p.230)

\"Karl's belief has the content that it is raining, and he is using the sentence "Es regnet" to express this belief (M), whence it further follows that "Es regnet" means that it is raining (S).\" (Kim, 2011, p.231)

\"This is evident when we reflect on the fact that the charity principle requires only that the entire system of beliefs attributed to a subject be by and large true but it does not tell us which of her beliefs must come out true.\" (Kim, 2011, p.232)

\"An alternative line of consideration can lead to content relativism rather than content irrealism: Instead of accepting the indeterminacy of belief, we might hold that whether a given belief exists is relative to a scheme of interpretation.\" (Kim, 2011, p.234)

\"What is it for a belief to "exist relative to a scheme" to begin with?\
Is it anything more than "the scheme attributes the belief to Karl"?\
If so, shouldn't we ask the further question whether what the scheme says is correct?\" (Kim, 2011, p.234)

\- \"But this takes us right back to the nonrelativized notion of belief existence.\" (Kim, 2011, p.234)

\"How do we account for her beliefs and desires---how do her intentional states get their contents?\" (Kim, 2011, p.234)\
\"how is self-interpretation possible?\
Don't we need an account of how we can know the contents of our own beliefs and desires?\
Do we just look inward, and are they just there for us to "see"?\
Or do we need to be interpreted by a third person if we are to have beliefs and meaningful speech?\" (Kim, 2011, p.234)

\"If Karl is a real and genuine believer, there must be a determinate answer to the question whether he has this belief. Whether someone happens to be interpreting Karl, or what any interpretive scheme says about Karl's belief system, should be entirely irrelevant to that question. This is content realism, a position that views interpretation only as a way of finding out something about Karl's belief system, not as constitutive of it.\" (Kim, 2011, p.235)

"How does a belief get to have the content it has?" (Kim, 2011, p.235)

Wide Content and Self Knowledge\
\"How do we know that Mary believes that water is wet and that Mary's twin on Twin Earth believes that twater is wet? Because we know that Mary's environment contains water and that Mary's twin's environment contains twater. Now consider the matter from Mary's point of view: How does she know that she believes that water is wet? How does she know the content of her own thoughts?\" (Kim, 2011, p.256)\
\"We believe that a subject has special, direct access to her own mental states. Perhaps the access is not infallible and does not extend to all mental states, but it is uncontroversial that there is special first-person authority in regard to one's own occurrent thoughts. When you reflect on what you are thinking, you apparently know directly, without further evidence or reasoning, what you think; the content of your thought is immediately and directly accessible to you, and the question of having evidence or doing research does not arise.\" (Kim, 2011, p.256)

\"First-person knowledge of the contents of one's own current thoughts is direct and immediate and carries a special sort of authority.\" (Kim, 2011, p.256)

\"content externalism would seem to have the consequence that most of our knowledge of our own intentional states is not direct and, like most other kinds of knowledge, must be based on evidence. That is to say, content externalism appears to be prima facie incompatible with privileged first-person access to one's own mind.\" (Kim, 2011, p.257)

Questions Regarding Mental Content

"How does a belief get to have the content it has?" (Kim, 2011, p.235)

\"How do we account for her beliefs and desires---how do her intentional states get their contents?\" (Kim, 2011, p.234)

\"how is self-interpretation possible?

\* Is it possible to misinterpret self-interpretation?

Don't we need an account of how we can know the contents of our own beliefs and desires?

Do we just look inward, and are they just there for us to "see"?

Or do we need to be interpreted by a third person if we are to have beliefs and meaningful speech?\" (Kim, 2011, p.234)

\"What is it for a belief to "exist relative to a scheme" to begin with?

Is it anything more than "the scheme attributes the belief to Karl"?

If so, shouldn't we ask the further question whether what the scheme says is correct?\" (Kim, 2011, p.234)

"are there beliefs with "narrow content"?\
"Putnam, the inventor of the Twin Earth parable, declared, "Cut the pie any way you like, 'meanings' just ain't in the head." (Kim, 2011, p.248)\
That means contents are wide according to Putnam.\
But is Narrow Content Possible?\
"the following two ideas that are normally taken to lie at the core of the notion of "narrow content" fail to coincide:\
(1) Narrow content is internal and intrinsic to the believer and does not involve anything outside her current state; and\
(2) narrow content, unlike wide content, supervenes on the current internal physical state of the believer." (Kim, 2011, p.253)\
"Technically, narrow content is a function from environmental contexts (including contexts of language acquisition) to wide contents (or truth conditions)." (Kim, 2011, p.254)

Questions Regarding Mental Content

\"how do these intentional states, or propositional attitudes, come to have the content they have and represent the state of affairs they represent?\"

\"what makes it the case that your hope and my belief have the same content?\" (Kim, 2011)

\"What is it about your hope and my belief that makes it the case that the same sentence can capture their content?\" (Kim, 2011)

Do animals have minds that includes mental contents? (Kim, 2011)

\"But how do neural-physical states come to have meanings---and come to have the particular meanings that they have?\" (Kim, 2011)

Concluding Remarks by Kim (2011) Why Intentional States are Important

"Content-carrying states---that is, intentional states like belief, desire, and the rest---constitute the central core of our commonsense ("folk") psychological practices, providing us with a framework for formulating explanations and predictions of what we and our fellow humans do. Without this essential tool for understanding and anticipating human action and behavior, a communal life would be unthinkable." (Kim, 2011, 257)

Burge's Thought-Experiment: Arthritis and "Tharthritis"\
Arthritis is pain in the joints. A person could have thigh pain and still call it Arthritis. This demonstrates the linguistic wide ness of content.\
In one of two cultures, one calls apple apple, in another they may call it gapple. Nonetheless, even if they saw the same thing they one would call the apple--- apple and the other gapple. This is because not of the internal states of the subjects, but because of the linguistic practices in the community to which they are accustomed to.\
"Burge argues, persuasively for most philosophers, that the example can be generalized to show that almost all contents are wide---that is, externally individuated." (Kim, 2011, p.245)

Important Definitions

What is Mental Content?

Mental content, as far as I understand is the, contents of out intentional states such as beliefs, thoughts, desires and emotions.

What is Content Externalism?

The idea that contents are wide and that \"the beliefs and desires we hold are not simply a matter of what is going on inside our minds or heads.\" is the doctrine of content externalism. (Kim, 2011, p.242)\
\"One problem about content that has received much attention recently is content externalism. This is the view, first advanced by Hilary Putnam and Tyler Burge, that physical and social factors external to the subject play a crucial role in determining the contents of that subject's beliefs and other intentional states. This means that what goes on 'within' you---your mind or your body---does not wholly determine the meanings of your thoughts or words (as it is put sometimes, meanings are not in your head). For example, you have the belief that water is wet, whereas your exact twin on 'Twin Earth', where water (that is, H2O) is replaced everywhere by a different but observationally indistinguishable substance, XYZ, has the belief that XYZ is wet, rather than the belief that water is wet. Or take a simpler example: you are looking at an apple, and your twin is also looking at an apple, which, as it happens, is qualitatively exactly similar to the one you are looking at. Your perceptual experience, let us say, is exactly similar to your twin's. However, your thought that here is a red apple and your twin's thought that here is a red apple have different contents---they are about different objects and their truth-conditions are different.\
This difference in thought content seems to stem not from any internal physical or mental differences between you and your twin, but from differences in the external environment. Just what the implications of content externalism are in regard to such questions as the truth of materialism, the causal powers of mental states, first-person epistemic authority on one's own mental states, and the nature of psychology as a science, are open questions.\" (Honderich, 2005)

What is Self-Knowledge?

What is Wide Content?

\"Beliefs whose content is individuated in this way are said to have "wide" or "broad" content.\" (Kim, 2011, p.242)

What is Narrow Content?

\"In contrast, beliefs whose content is individuated solely on the basis of what goes on inside the persons holding them are said to have "narrow" content.\" (Kim, 2011, p.242)

THE CAUSAL-CORRELATIONAL APPROACH: INFORMATIONAL SEMANTICS

There seems to be a causal correlations between what the content of what we sense and what we believe.

Frogs hunt with their tongue. If a frog mistakes a dirt for a mosquito, then his senses and the contents of his beliefs seem to contradict. The the frog\'s content of belief was a mosquito, and the sensory content should have identified a dirt.

Perceptual information has causal link with contents of intentionality. i.e. thoughts, belief, desire, emotion. But Kim says this is not always the case for all intentional states in general.

Observational beliefs are easy to explain in terms of perceptual information, but it is not always the case for all beliefs, such as belief of unseen entities like God or ghosts.

Mental Content (Kim, 2011) Page 227-228

How can intentional states can have content?\
Intentional states include

\* Wish\
\* desire\
\* belief\
Questions that Kim asks:\
\* \"how do these intentional states, or propositional attitudes, come to have the content they have and represent the state of affairs they represent?\" (Kim, 2011)\
\* \"what makes it the case that your hope and my belief have the same content?\" (Kim, 2011)\
\* \"What is it about your hope and my belief that makes it the case that the same sentence can capture their content?\" (Kim, 2011)\
\* Do animals have minds that includes mental contents? (Kim, 2011)\
\* \"But how do neural-physical states come to have meanings---and come to have the particular meanings that they have?\" (Kim, 2011)\
\"These physical-biological states have representational content---they are about things, inside or outside an organism, and represent them as being a certain way. In a word, these states have meanings: A neural state that represents a bear as approaching means that a bear is approaching.\" (Kim, 2011)

\"We routinely ascribe states with content to persons, animals, and even some nonbiological systems. If we had no such practice---if we were to stop attributing to people around us beliefs, desires, emotions, and the like---our communal life would surely suffer a massive collapse.\" (Kim, 2011)

Mental Content

Notes

Normal Condition\
\"Consider a mercury thermometer: The height of the column of mercury indicates the ambient air temperature. When the thermometer registers 32°C, we say, "The thermometer says that the temperature is 32°C"; we also say that the current state of the thermometer carries the information that the air temperature is 32°C. Why? Because there is a lawful correlation---in fact, a causal connection---between the state of the thermometer (that is, the height of its mercury column) and air temperature. It is for that reason that the device is a thermometer, something that carries information about ambient temperature.\" (Kim, 2011, p.236)

Belief

A mental state, representational in character, taking a proposition (either true or false) as its content and involved, together with motivational factors, in the direction and control of voluntary behaviour. (\*Thinking; \*propositional attitude; \*representation.) Belief (thought) is often (especially in the philosophy of mind) taken to be the primary cognitive state; other cognitive and conative states (e.g. knowledge, perception, memory, intention) being some combination of belief and other factors (such as truth and justification in the case of knowledge). In referring to beliefs---to Ted's belief that snow is white, for instance---one may be referring to either a particular mental state occurring in the believer (a state that has content) or the propositional content itself---something more like a meaning that is not locatable in thebeliever. In the first case, Ted's belief that snow is white is not the same as Tom's belief that snow is white. They occur in different heads. In the second sense, they are the same belief: that snow is white. What Ted and Tom believe (i.e. the propositional content of their belief ) is the same.\
Beliefs involve the deployment of \*concepts: one cannot believe that something is a cow unless one understands what a cow is and, in this sense, has the concept cow (one needn't, of course, understand the word 'cow'). One can, to be sure, have beliefs about cows (these are called \*de re or demonstrative beliefs) without knowing what a cow is. One can, for instance, believe that that animal, the one you see, is spotted. If that animal happens to be a cow, one believes of the cow that it is spotted and, thus, has a belief about a cow. But one cannot believe of the cow (or of anything else for that matter) that it is a cow (the word 'cow' here appears in what is called an oblique or referentially opaque position) without understanding what a cow is. Since concepts can remain distinct even when their reference is the same, belief descriptions are \*intensional in character. Some beliefs (called 'core' beliefs) are at the forefront of consciousness---things one is, at the moment, actually thinking about. Others are not. Even if you thought about it once (when you learned geography), you were not consciously thinking, a moment ago, that San Francisco is in California. None the less, it seems correct to say that you believed it even when you weren't actively thinking about it. Other beliefs seem even more remote from consciousness, even more part of the background. Even if you never consciously thought about whether turtles wear pyjamas, it seems right to say that you none the less believed they did not wear pyjamas before your attention was ever called to the fact.\
Beliefs, together with other mental states (desires, fears, intentions) function as \*reasons for action. Thus, beliefs are to be distinguished from a variety of other internal representations that control reflexes and other non-intentional behaviours. There is a difference between closing your eyes as a reflexive response to a sudden movement (a response that is controlled by an internal representation of nearby events) and closing your eyes purposely, because you have certain desires (to avoid eye injury) and beliefs (that someone's finger is headed for your eye).\
There are two broadly contrasting views about the nature of belief content. Individualists (sometimes called solipsists) maintain that the content of belief (what it is we believe when we believe something) supervenes on the neurobiology of the believer. If two individuals are physically indistinguishable, then they are psychologically indistinguishable. They must, therefore, have the same beliefs. Non-individualists, on the other hand, hold that belief content is, at least in part, determined by the believer's environment. Two individuals that are physically identical could have different beliefs. A version of non-individualism maintains that a person's social---including linguistic--- context helps fix the content of what they believe. (Honderich, 2005)\

Mental Content

Non-conceptual Content\
Theorists of non-conceptual mental content hold that some mental states can represent the world and be true or false even though the bearer of those mental states does not possess the \*concepts required to specify how they represent the world (to specify their content). This basic idea has been used to try to do justice to the differences between how the world is represented in perceptual experience and how it is represented in belief, as well as to elucidate the representational content of subpersonal computational states, such as those appealed to in information-processing accounts of vision. On some accounts of what it is to possess a concept, the representational states of non-linguistic creatures such as human infants and non-human animals have nonconceptual content. Not all of these developments and applications are consistent with each other, but each offers a challenge to the widely held view that the way in which a creature can represent the world is determined by its conceptual capacities.

j.ber. \*cognition; perception.

(Honderich, 2005)

Importance of Content In terms of Folk Psychology

\"Content-carrying states---that is, intentional states like belief, desire, and the rest---constitute the central core of our commonsense ("folk") psychological practices, providing us with a framework for formulating explanations and predictions of what we and our fellow humans do. Without this essential tool for understanding and anticipating human action and behavior, a communal life would be unthinkable.\" (Kim, 2011, p.257)

MISREPRESENTATION AND THE TELEOLOGICAL APPROACH

\"One important fact about representation is the possibility of misrepresentation. Misrepresentation does occur; you, or a mental-neural state of yours, may represent that there are horses in the field when there are none in sight.\" (Kim, 2011, p.239)

The perceptual content can be misrepresented in the content of belief.

The Teleological Approach

Solves this problem by using the concept of function.\
There could to be a pre-perceived perceptual content of horses instilled in the subject. According to teleology this is performing the function of recognising horses. Thus when the subject sees anything similar such as a shadowy figure, it misrepresents the content of perception in the content of belief affected by its instilled function.

The teleological function theory is backed up with evolutionary hypothesis. That organism are conditioned to adapt to perceptions and thus can make mistakes of representation due to perceptual similarity of objects. We identify and have quick reflex to sudden projectiles of threats in similar manner, precisely because of the evolutionary conditioning.
