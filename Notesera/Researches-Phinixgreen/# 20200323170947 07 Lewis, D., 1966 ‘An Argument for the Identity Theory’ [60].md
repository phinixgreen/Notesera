Lewis offers functionalist argument for type-type psychophysical identity theory.

Lewis argues that functionalism

I. Introduction

II\. The nature of the Identity Theory

"The identity theory asserts that physical states are experiences, introspectible processes or activities, not that they are the supposed intentional objects that experiences are experiences of."

Lewis states that "Shaffer has argued ... \[that\] experiences are, by analytic necessity, unallocated, whereas the (abstract particular) neural events that they supposedly are have a location \[which is physical\]" (Lewis, 1966, p.3)

Lewis holds that Shaffer is mistaken and experiences are located in neural substance, therefore are physical events.

Identity theory implies that neural state ascriptions and the experience ascriptions have the same reference. I.e. Pain is the common reference for experience ascription (that, I am in pain), and neural state ascription (that, his C-Fibre is firing)

Lewis also argues that the neural state ascription has a definitive causal role whereas experience ascription is "the attribute of being in whatever state that occupies that causal role"

This is an objection which establishes a non-identity between attribution of experiences and neural states, but not between experiences and neural states. In other words, it is indicative of the fact that descriptions may vary but they all indicate that pain is a physical phenomenon.
