Comparison between Biological Organism and Silicon Based System in relation to CTM

Block and Fodor (1972, p.161) contends that If \"the conceptual possibility that psychological predicates could apply to artifacts" \[then\] "it seems likely that given any psychophysical correlation which holds for an organism, it is possible to build a machine which is similar to the organism psychologically, but physiologically sufficiently different from the organism that the psychophysical correlation does not hold for the machine"

Identity theorists objected to Putnam's view that by virtue of evolution, the pain bearers have one thing in common--- that is they have similar physical-chemical kind to experience the type identical pain states. But they also argue that any other physical kind that do not have similar physical-chemical kind (i.e.silicon based systems) will not be able to realize pain as we do because they lack the similar elemental physical composition, structure and complexity.

Putnam claims that these objections are \""certainly ambitious" and very probably false\" because early identity theories were empirical hypotheses. (SEP, ?)

I intend to argue on this point that having similar physical-chemical kind is necessary to experience similar mental kinds, and that this proves the multiple realizability ontologically mistaken to certain extent.
