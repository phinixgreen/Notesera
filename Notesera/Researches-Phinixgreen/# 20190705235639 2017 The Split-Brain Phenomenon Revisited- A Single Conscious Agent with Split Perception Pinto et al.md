\#\#Abstract

\"The split-brain phenomenon is caused by the surgical severing of the corpus callosum, the main route of communication between the cerebral hemispheres. The classical view of this syndrome asserts that conscious unity is abolished. The left hemisphere consciously experiences and functions independently of the right hemisphere. This view is a cornerstone of current consciousness research. In this review, we first discuss the evidence for the classical view. We then propose an alternative, the 'conscious unity, split perception' model. This model asserts that a split brain produces one conscious agent who experiences two parallel, unintegrated streams of information. In addition to changing our view of the split-brain phenomenon, this new model also poses a serious challenge for current dominant theories of consciousness\"

## The Five Hallmarks of the Split-Brain Syndrome

\"in split-brain patients, communication between the left and the right cerebral hemisphere is almost completely abolished.\"

p\. 836

1.  \"When a stimulus is presented to the left visual field, the patient can only respond adequately with his/her left hand, and vice versa for the right field and hand.\"

2.  They show Hemispheric Specialization, two hemispheres are better at different tasks

3.  \"post hoc confabulations after actions with the left hand\"

4.  \"each hemisphere may have its own independent focus of attention\"

5.  \"incapable of comparing stimuli across the visual midline\"

To explain these symptoms classical theories of consciousness are formulated.

## Two classical models of consciousness

1.  Classical Model of Consciousness 1 / partial consciousness model: \"only the left hemisphere gives rise to consciousness, while the right hemisphere only processes information in an unconscious manner. The right hemisphere may prime the left hemisphere toward certain behavior, but this will only affect consciousness after it has been molded and interpreted by the left hemisphere. This is the so-called partial consciousness model\"

2.  Classical Model of Consciousness 2 / Split Consciousness model: \"in a split-brain patient each hemisphere has its own consciousness, independent of the other hemisphere. Thus, according to this 'split consciousness' model, a split-brain patient houses two independent conscious agents.

Sperry \[24\] writes that in a split consciousness model the two hemispheres acts as if they are 'two separate conscious entities or minds running in parallel in the same cranium, each with its own sensations, perceptions, cognitive processes' (p. 318).

## Concluding Remarks and Future Perspectives

-   The authors argue that the classical view of split brain syndrome may not hold because,

1.  hemispheric specialisation, inability to explain own actions, and split attention also occur in healthy adults with unified consciousness
2.  the response x visual field interaction does not hold for all split-brain patients
3.  in the absence of any convincing proof against split consciousness, unified consciousness should be the default position.

-   They suggest that consciousness remains unified even when minimal axonal connections between subcortical structures or certain key parts remain directly connected. Another possibility is the functional notion of consciousness which states that consciousness remains unified even when a minimal amount of synchronisation between subsystems remain intact irrespective of direct or indirect connections driven synchrony.

> \"If consciousness is indeed mostly dependent on functional structure, then preserved functional unity could underlie conscious unity in the split-brain syndrome.\" (p.847)
