\#\# The problem of ownership

\> \"This problem is one which must be faced by any philosopher who wants to hold that phenomenally conscious states are physical. The problem is that of explaining how the mental objects of experience and feeling -- such as particular pains, after-images, tickles, itches -- could be physical, given that they are necessarily owned and necessarily private to their owners." (p.24)

\> "the pain you are feeling -- that particular pain -- is private to you. It is yours alone, and necessarily so. No one else could have that particular pain. Of course, conceivably somebody else could have a pain that felt just like your pain, but only you could have that very pain. What is true for this one pain is true for pains gener- ally. Indeed, it is true for all mental objects of experience. None of these items of experience can be shared. I cannot have your visual images or feel your tickles, for example. Your images and tickles necessarily belong to you." (p.24)
