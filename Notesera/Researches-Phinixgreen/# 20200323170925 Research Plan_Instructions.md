## 1. Title

-   Make it short and memorable
-   Use appropriate terminology to help find it

## 2. Abstract or summary

-   Overview not more than one page long
-   Should include the rationale, main objectives, methods for the work to be undertaken
-   Write this after writing your research plan

## 3. Background, Context or Rationale

-   refer briefly to relevant research, audit or evaluation
-   Explain how your proposed project will contribute to these
-   Mention why you wish to conduct the Project
-   Mention why it is relevant, important and timely
-   Should reflect that you are aware of the current development in your field

## 4. Aims and objectives

-   aim is general, high level statement of what it is that you wish to explore
-   objective is specific questions that will address the different aspects of the aim.

Should be SMART - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound

## 5. Hypothesis

-   Include if you have a quantitative approach

## 6. Literature Review

-   You should be familiar with the key issues and theories from your Background
-   Should be able to identify any gaps
-   You will also have established that your proposed research area has not already been covered by another researcher
    -   Funder likes recent Literature

## 7. Research Design and methods

Should cover the following

-   the overall approach to research (research methodology): overarching framework, qualitative, quantitative, mix method
-   Choice of research method, technique and tools: describe methods, techniques and appropriate tools for collecting and analysing data. Suitable methods Include-
    -   Desk research
    -   Surveys
    -   Interviews
    -   Case Studies
    -   Observations Corresponding data collection techniques Include-
    -   Questionnaires
    -   Interview schedule
    -   Observation checklists\
        List any tool that you might use for data collection, i.e. Surveymonkey, SPSS, nVivo
-   Scope and boundaries: Set limits of what you will do and what you will not attempt to do while collecting data
-   Sampling: Mention if quantitative approach
-   Research Data Management: A data management plan indicates how you intend to collect, process and store document and provide access to your data.

## 8. Ethical issues

-   You should show an awareness of any relevant organisational, professional or legal guidelines for conducting research
-   Describe main ethical issues arising from your project and indicate how you intend to handle these
-   Indicate whether ethical approval has been sought or obtained (build this into project timetable)

## 9. Project timetable

-   Pin down a realistic and achievable timescale
-   Determine how long each part is likely to take

-   If research method relies on emergent theory then it may be difficult to define the task list.
-   Gantt chart is helpful

Figure 3.

-   it\'s good to build contingency time for the Project
-   Other tools (network diagram, critical path analysis, program evaluation and review technique)

## 10. Deliverables, outputs and outcomes

-   Do not promise more than you are able to deliver
-   outputs: Outputs are the things you introduce as part of your project. These are tangible and Measurable
-   outcomes: Outcomes are the results and consequences of the project and may be harder to pin down.
-   A dissemination plan can be included: This will describe how you intend to disseminate the findings of your work and why it will be important to the audience.

## 11. Risk Assessment

Ask yourself

-   What risks might prevent a successful outcome to the Project?
-   What is the probability of each risk occurring?
-   what would be the impact on the project if a risk occurred?
-   How will a risk be managed?

Four ways of managing risks

1.  Accept the consequences (Accept that there is an unplanned absence of staff)
2.  Transfer the risks. (i.e. travel insurance to mitigate delayed flight)
3.  Avoid the risk (i.e. Avoid risk by predicting results)
4.  Reduce the risk (i.e. Having acknowledged that risk may occur, take steps to reduce the effect)

Figure 4. Table of Risks

\| Risk \|Probability(P) 1=low 5=high\| Severity (S)1=low 5=high\|Risk Score(PxS)\| Mitigation \| \|\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--\|\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--\|\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--\|\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--\|\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--\| \|Data lost due to computer failure \| 3 \| 5 \| 15 \| Ensure data backed up at the end of the every day. Keep multiple copies in secure storage \| \|Project is not completed on time \| 3 \| 3 \| 9 \| Build extra time at key stages, monitor progress against gantt chart, seek additional resource if slippage threatens final completion date \| \|Project cost exceed budgets \| 1 \| 5 \| 5 \| Build contingency funds, monitor cost throughout the project, consider making savings in non-essential activities \| \|Recording device failure in interview \| 2 \| 2 \| 4 \| Test device beforehand. Use two devices for recording \|

-   Ask advise from your colleague after drawing the table of risks.

## 12. Resource and Costs

-   producing a budget will show that you are aware of the financial implications of time spending on this work
-   it may also help to show that a relatively small investment may result into significant outcome for the organisation.

Budget could include-

1.  Staff costs (salary or hourly wages)
2.  Overhead costs (indirect cost, benefit, administrative costs)
3.  Consultancy or professional fees
4.  Equipment
5.  Hardware and software (for data analysis)
6.  Materials (printing and consumables)
7.  Travel and expenses (attend project meetings, interview participants, present at conferences, visit other libraries)
8.  Publication costs (self publish a project report, cover \'author pays\' charges to commercial publisher)
9.  Marketing and promotion costs (attract participants, provide incentives to encourage participation, disseminate findings)

## 13. Project Evaluation

How to know the project has been a success?

The project plan should indicate how, when and by whom the success of the project will be evaluated. Methods of evaluation might include feedback from stakeholders, usage statistics, peer review, etc.

Evaluation is better done both by the researcher himself and third-party

if for funding, then Funders evaluation may be included

Alternative is a reflective approach. Ask,

what went well?

What could have been done better?

What others can learn from the project?

What still needs to be done?

Keep a daily project log for self evaluation

You may discuss the lessons learned, future impacts of the research could be measured of assessed

## Further Considerations

### General Advice on writing plan

-   write in straightforward language
-   develop ideas logically and clearly
-   Use signposts and headings, linking between sections to emphasise the flow through plan
-   Make sure facts are accurate
-   Emphasise key points not details
-   Check for typos
-   Avoid jargons
-   Avoid too much acronyms
-   Avoid repetition
-   Make use of figure and illustrations
-   Pay attention to the presentation of the plan. Clean and tidy presentation goes a long way.

### Planning Collaborative Research

-   be clear on each partner\'s role and responsibilities
-   one partner should be the lead partner
-   project management activities should be included in the plan
-   add the partnership as an extra risk

### Evaluating the research plan

Check

presentation

typo

spelling mistakes

ask a colleague to have a look at the research plan
