A Turing machine is a specific type of computational system which is based on logical manipulation of symbols.

A Turing machine is composed of four components,

1\. A machine tape: is a long tape with individual cells, each allocated for a symbol which are temporary placed there

2\. A machine head: is a symbol reader and writer, that can both read the symbols on the cells on the machine tape, or replace symbols on individual cells according to given instructions

3\. A Machine Table: is a table where the Turing machine is provided a set of instructions.

The input is reading the symbol. And the output could be either/and to write, move or halt.

4\. Machine states: For the input to be processed, the Turing machine needs to break down a complicated problem into simple steps and complete them. The machine states are simply each steps of this process. The initial state begins with reading symbol and the final state is usually halting. The in between states usually follow the machine table to decide what to do next until it reaches the final state.
