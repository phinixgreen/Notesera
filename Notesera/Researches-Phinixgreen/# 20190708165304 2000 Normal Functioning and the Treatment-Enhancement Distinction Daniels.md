\# The Primary Rationale for Medical Obligations

\> Required to allow every individual a level playing field.

\*\*Distinguishing Level Playing field and Normal Functioning\*\*

Departure from Normal Functioning is classified as diseases and disability for biomedical sciences.

\_Our views of diseases sometimes influence Medical views of Normal Functioning\_

But the interest is in providing equal opportunity to everyone it terms of medical treatment.

\*\*Distinguishing Level Playing field and Normal Functioning\*\*

Rawls\' Interpretation of level playing field is applied and extended to biomedical sciences as normal functioning.

\` Problem of Distribution of Normal Functioning and Level Playing field \`

In the case of level playing field, compensation is provided to lesser fortunate individuals, to bring them closer to more privileged individuals.

Apply this in the case of Tallness. If all short person becomes tall, then the idea of tall becomes redundant.

In that case, what should be the average height? And if someone aspires to become taller, shouldn\'t others be allowed the chance? The treatment-enhancement distinction becomes problematic when deciding on a standard, social influence and personal choice and liberty.

\> \"it is critical to keep in mind that the treatment-enhancement distinction by itself does not specify the boundary between obligatory and nonobligatory medical services\" \\(?\\)
