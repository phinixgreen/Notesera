\> \"Machine functionalists claim that we can think of the mind as a Turing machine (or a probabilistic automaton)."-(Kim, 2011, p.147)

\"The central idea is that what it is for something to have mentality---that is, to have a psychology---is for it to be a physically realized Turing machine of appropriate complexity, with its mental states (that is, mental-state types) identified with the realizers of the internal states of the machine table." (Kim, 2011, p.147)

\"Perhaps there might be non-carbon-based or non-protein-based biological organisms with mentality, and we cannot a priori preclude the possibility that electromechanical systems, like the "intelligent" robots and androids in science fiction, might be capable of having beliefs, desires, and even sensations. All this suggests an interesting feature of mental concepts: They seem to carry no constraint on the actual physical-biological mechanisms that realize or implement them." (Kim, 2011, p.131)

\"A computational view of mentality also shows that we must expect mental states to be multiply realized. We know that any computational process can be implemented in a variety of physically diverse computing machines." (Kim, 2011, p.132)

\"If minds are like computers and mental processes---in particular, cognitive processes---are, at bottom, computational processes, we should expect no prior constraint on just how minds and mental processes are physically implemented, that is, realized. Just as vastly different physical devices can execute the same computational program, so vastly different biological or physical systems should be able to subserve the same cognitive processes. Such is the core of the functionalist conception of the mind." (Kim, 2011, p.132)

\"how complex is complex enough? What is complexity anyway, and why does it matter? And what kind of complexity is "appropriate" for mentality? These are important but difficult questions, and machine functionalism, unsurprisingly, has not produced detailed general answers to them." (Kim, 2011, p.156)\"\
