# 20200327011212 Economic Trends and Ethical Imperatives during COVID-19


This note argues that on the event of COVID-19 Outbreak worldwide, the present Economic Distribution of Resources is failing a great number of individuals worldwide, therefore we may need a global economic reform. To support my argument, I will first consider, why COVID-19 has created an precendented situation. I will highlight that the world is run by the invisible hand of market, and it is specifically a threat to the invisible hand of the market, why COVID-19 is more than an usual global threat. Then I will look at the Supply Chain Relationship, how in a globalized world consumers of developed nations have lived on the cheap labor of under-developed countries. It is the both way parasitic-symbiosis, that have been keeping the world running. However, with COVID-19, the situation has unfolded that of a sinking pyramid. The most vulnerable population, demographically, economically, socially and politically will be worst sufferer of this outbreak. Meanwhile, individuals who have better survival capacity, may feel safe, temporarily, assuming survivalist mindset. However, it is a prisonners dilemma in disguise, and humanists urge to be considerate to everyone equally. A valid objection may arise, on being pragmatic in times of distress, such as clinical triages, which becomes necessary in many places. One may also argue that we must use the resources we have at the moment strategically and to best utilize the resources, countries should lock their borders. The counter objection to these arguments will not be easy, however, we ask ourselves why clinical triages are necessary in the first place. If the governments across the world have been responsible, there triage situations may have arised less. If the parasitic relations between nations were otherwise, the some governments could have supported their people. Therefore, closing the borders might not be safe solution in the longterm. What is needed is transparency, collaboration, and cooperation across the large governance bodies.   



### Introduction
COVID-19 has spread worldwide. Governments are closing down borders and asking citizens to stay indoors. Meanwhile hospitals are fighting with the resource scarcity and overwhelming number of patients. It has also created a state of panic worldwide. 

It is expected that sooner or later the fight will be over. However, the impact of COVID-19 on world economy provides us yet another warning for humanity.



### Argument 1: The present Economic Distribution of Resources is failing a great number of individuals worldwide, therefore we may need a global economic reform.

### Background
I will first consider, why COVID-19 has created an precendented situation. I will highlight that the world is run by the invisible hand of market, and it is specifically a threat to the invisible hand of the market, why COVID-19 is more than an usual global threat.

### The Supply Chain Relationship
Then I will look at the Supply Chain Relationship, how in a globalized world consumers of developed nations have lived on the cheap labor of under-developed countries. It is the both way parasitic-symbiosis, that have been keeping the world running.

Businesses that are electronic will suffer less rather than businesses that rely on physical presence and manual labor. In Supply Chain, The buyers need processed materials. The suppliers need revenue. The laborers need earnings. If buyers halt the demand, even temporarily, the pressure will be on laborers indirectly, since the suppliers will not be able to pay them.

One example is Bangladesh. The Ready Made Garments sector of Bangladesh have recently faced threat from both buyers' and suppliers' end due to the outbreak of COVID-19. It was initially assumed that the country would benefit from Pandemic as most of the global brands were planning to shift their export orders from China to other RMG manufacturing countries such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, Indonesia and Cambodia.

Among other factors, it is also true that the Disruption of the Supply Chain Economy is one of the major concerns. The supply-chain economy is a major constituent of invisible hand of the global market. 


### The Sinking Pyramid
However, with COVID-19, the situation has unfolded that of a sinking pyramid. The most vulnerable population, demographically, economically, socially and politically will be worst sufferer of this outbreak. 

At the bottom of the pyramid are the Demographically vulnerable individuals. Elderly population are mostly at risk [Link?] Diabetic patients and individuals with certain blood groups are vulnerable. Meanwhile, the level of vulnerabilty increases if these people also fell in economically vulnerable criteria. They could include, individuals without earning, wage earners, people who are at the end of the supply chain, people whose service has become irrelevant in the context of COVID-19. On the other hand if they fall into the socially and polically vulnerable, chances are that they fall into the two previous categories
as well. These people are the refugees, migrants, and homeless people.

According to UNHCR - "More than 70 million people globally have been forced by persecution, conflict, violence and human rights violations to flee their homes. Of those, more than 20 million are refugees, of whom 84 per cent are being hosted by low or middle-income nations which have weaker health and water and sanitation systems." [[https://www.unhcr.org/news/press/2020/3/5e677f634/un-refugee-agency-steps-covid-19-preparedness-prevention-response-measures.html][UNHCR]]. The COVID-19 will likely wipe out majority of these people, and their death might not matter to most. Demographically capable individuals such as healthy individuals with good immune system might survive the virus. Economically, Socially and Politically privileged individuals will be able to support their security, medication and treatment on priority basis. 

### Trends in Responses to COVID-19
Individuals who have better survival capacity, may feel safe, temporarily, assuming survivalist mindset. One possible example could be the approach to Herd Immunity. In order to manage the outbreak and prevent a catastrophopic Second Wave of Pandemic in near future, it has been suggested that whole of population could be exposed to the pandemic to generate immunity could in younger people.

In counter, the Herd Immunity Argument it has been argued that by doing so, the number of patients at peak of infection will explode leading to becoming left without proper treatment.

When I heard about Britain’s ‘herd immunity’ coronavirus plan, I thought it was satire]]

This is a prisonners dilemma in disguise, and humanists urge to be considerate to everyone equally. 

It has also been argued that the distribution of health and diseases are reflection of our social organization and how we relate to one another. In order to achieve collective good, we also need individual good. People who are infected with COVID-19 and people who are vulnerable, should not be sacrificed for the greater good. Each has equal rights to live, and there should be granted equal opportunity to live.

### Objection

A valid objection may arise, on being pragmatic in times of distress, such as clinical triages, which becomes necessary in many places. One may also argue that we must use the resources we have at the moment strategically and to best utilize the resources, countries should focus on their own and lock their borders.

### Counter 
The counter objection to these arguments will not be easy.

Clinical triage is usually performed to decide treatment options between or among multiple patients who need the same treatment against low available of utility and resource support. This may include the rations, the medical resources, the emergency treatment and support for the patients. The choices could involve, cases where allocation is needed when enough masks or ventilation machines are not available or providing vaccines when there is a shortage of supply. [[If Covid-19 gets bad, triage will be needed. Are we ready for that?][https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/covid-19-gets-bad-are-we-prepared-for-triage/#EthicalPrinciples]]

Clinical Triage is a pragmatic approach, and although the burden of decision is usually put on Doctors, the source of dillemma isn't often the one's taking the decision. We may ask why there were there not enough masks or ventilator machines available? However asking these questions will not solve the problem. Yet, it could make us more responsible for taking corrective measures. Global healthcare world-wide had already been suffering. If the governments across the world have been responsible, these triage situations may have arised on less occassions. If being pragmatic is so necessary now, why were we not being pragmatic before the Outbreak? Closing the borders now, will not solve damage done, it might be safe for now, but the wave of economic recession will hit the poorest hard. It's not the poor who travel most internationally, but the wealthy and privileged.

### Recommendation
What is needed now are transparency, collaboration, and cooperation across the large governance bodies.
