\#\# What is Levels

\> \"Craver draws an equivalent distinction between levels of science and levels of nature (Craver 2007, p. 171). Levels of science subsume relationships among the basic products or output of scientific research (e.g., models and theories) and the basic units or institutional divisions of science (e.g., research fields and disciplines). For example, the proposal that string theory is at a lower level than the theory of genetic drift posits something about the relationship among levels of science. These are episte- mic levels. By contrast, levels of nature refer to relationships among phenomena (e.g., properties, states, events, and objects) in the natural world ... \"\
What is nomology

\> \"relating to or denoting principles that resemble laws, especially those laws of nature which are neither logically necessary nor theoretically explicable, but just are so." \[Oxford Dictionary\]

\` Note: I think I will need to revisit Functionalism and Computational Theory of Mind \`

\- \[ \] David Marr's \*\*Levels of Analysis\*\*
