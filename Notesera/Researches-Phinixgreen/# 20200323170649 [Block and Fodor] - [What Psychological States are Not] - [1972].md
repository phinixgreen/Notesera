Chapter Extract 159

"different organisms are often in psychological states of exactly the same type at one time or another, and a given organism is often in psychological states of exactly the same type at different times. Whenever either is the case, we shall say of the psychological states of the organism(s) in question that they are type identical." (Block and Fodor, 1972, p.159)

Identity States

Subject A has Psychological State A at time t1\
Subject B has psychological State B at time t2

If t1 =/= t2 and Psychological State A = Psychological State B\
Then it is said that subject organisms A and B have type identity states.

\"two organisms are in type identical psychological states if and only if certain of their behaviors or behavioral dispositions are type identical\"(Block and Fodor, 1972, p.159)

"some (though not all) varieties of physicalism claim that organisms\
are in type-identical psychological states if and only if certain of their physical states are type identical\"(Block and Fodor, 1972, p.159)

Behaviorism

According to Behaviorists-\
Subject A has Behavioral Disposition at time t1\
Subject B has Behavioral Disposition B at time t2

If t1 =/= t2 and Behavioral Disposition A = Behavioral Disposition B\
Then it is said that subject organisms A and B are type identical in terms of Behavioral Disposition

Physicalism

Subject A has Physical State A at time t1\
Subject B has Physical State B at time t1

If t1 =/= t2 and Physical State A = Physical State B\
Then it is said that subject organisms A and B are physical states which are type identical

Objections against Behaviorism and Physicalism

"it seems increasingly unlikely that either behaviorism or physicalism is true"(Block and Fodor, 1972, p.160)

\"The fundamental argument against behaviorism is simply that what an organism does or is disposed to do at a given time is a very complicated function of its beliefs and desires together with its current sensory inputs and memories. It is thus enormously unlikely that it will prove possible to pair behavioral predicates with psychological predicates in the way that behaviorism require\"(Block and Fodor, 1972, p.160)

\"Behaviorism cannot be true unless mind/behavior correlationism is true, and mind/behavior correlationism is not true." (Block and Fodor, 1972, p.160)

Block and Fodor (1972, p.160) contends that it is increasingly unlikely that either physicalism or behaviorism is true and then goes on to explain the arguments against behaviourism and physicalism.

Arguments against behaviorism

If, Subject A has\
Psychological State A1, Psychological States A2\
Behavioural Dispositions A1, Behavioural Dispositions A2

If Subject A is in Psychological State A1 iff Behavioural Dispositions A1 is true at t1\
And Subject A is in Psychological State A2 iff Behavioural Dispositions A2 is true at t2\
And t1 =/= t2 then\
Behaviorism is true because there is a correlation between Psychological Predicates (States A1, A2) and Behavioural Predicates (Dispositions A1, A2)

But

\_\_Psychological Predicates do not pair with behavioural predicates\_\_ therefore there is no correlation. Therefore, behaviourism is false.

\"The argument against physicalism rests upon the empirical likelihood that creatures of different composition and structure, which are in no interesting sense in identical physical states, can nevertheless be in identical psychological states; hence that types\
of psychological states are not in correspondence with types of physical states. This point has been made persuasively in Putnam's \"Psychological Predicates.\"(Block and Fodor, 1972, p.160)

Argument against Physicalism

Objections against physicalism focuses that different subjects A and B may have\
Psychological State A= Psychological State B\
But not Physical State A =/= Physical State B

Empirical arguments against Physicalism (p.160)

Lashleyan Doctrine against Physicalism

"the Lashleyan doctrine of neurological equipotentiality holds that any of a wide variety of psychological functions can be\
served by any of a wide variety of brain structures. While the generality of this doctrine may be disputed, it does seem clear\
that the central nervous system is highly labile and that a given type of psychological process is in fact often associated with a\
variety of distinct neurological structures\"(Block and Fodor, 1972, p.160)

1\. \*\*For Equipotentials,\*\*

Right hemisphere = Left hemisphere

1\. \*\*For right handed person\*\*

Right hemisphere =/= Left hemisphere

1\. For physicalism Equipotentials have

Left Side of the Body = Right Side of the Body

1\. For Physicalism Right handed person have

Left Side of the Body = Right Side of the Body

Therefore,

Either Equipotentiality is true or Physicalism is true

Then,

Equipotentialism is empirically proven (although disputed) therefore, physicalism is False

Darwinian Doctrine of Convergence

\"The second consideration depends on the assumption that the Darwinian doctrine of convergence applies to the phylogeny of\
psychology as well as to the phylogeny of morphology and of behavior. It is well known that superficial morphological similarities\
between organisms may represent no more than parallel evolutionary solutions of the same environmental problem" (Block and Fodor, 1972, p.161)

\"But if there are organisms whose psychology is homologous to our own but whose physiology is quite different, such organisms provide counterexamples to the psychophysical\
correlations physicalism requires.\"(Block and Fodor, 1972, p.161)

Darwininan Doctrine implies that organisms having homologus physiology and should have similar psychology.

But if there is some organism whose psychology is similar to our own but physiology is not then it provides counter example to physicalism which says that physical identity implies psychological identity.

Since Darwininan Doctrine is held true, physicalism is false.

Chapter Extract 6

If \"the conceptual possibility that psychological predicates could apply to artifacts" \[then\] "it seems likely that given any psychophysical correlation which holds for an organism, it is possible to build a machine which is similar to the organism psychologically, but physiologically sufficiently different from the organism that the psychophysical correlation does not hold for the machine" (Block and Fodor, 1972, p.161)
