\- Consciousness can be passive as well as active and effortful.\
- Passive consciousness: Paying no attention to this and that, sensory input that free control of our conscious states.\
- Active consciousness: Pay attention to the constant flow of sensory input to which we are exposed, perception becomes action oriented activity.

Passive: Seeing, Hearing, Feeling\
Active : Watching, Listening, Touching

\- In most states of consciousness, there is an awareness of being situated, located in time and space and an awareness of our bodies.

\- There is also often a conscious fringe, the awareness of being\
right or wrong, satisfied or not, feelings of familiarity.

\- Conscious experience varies in its intensity.\
- Attention is the ability to select of differentially amplify certain conscious experiences to the exclusion of others.

\- Consciousness is linked to memory.\
- immediate memory lasts a fractions of a second, often equated with consciousness itself.\
- working memory provides the ability to keep in mind and manipulate conscious contents is also closely related to consciousness.

\#\# Unity and Coherence of Conscious experience

\- The unity of consciousness experience is closely associated with coherence of perceptual events.

\- The need to make a coherent, conscious scene out of seemingly disparate elements is seen at all levels and in all modalities of consciousness.

Capacity limitation: The unity and coherence of consciousness are strictly tied to consciousness\'s capacity limitation- the fact that we cannot keep in mind more than few things at a time.

we cannot make more than one decision at a time, no matter how simple, within a few hundred milliseconds.

Finally, each conscious states is not only unified but more or less stable. Although conscious contents change continually, the experience remains continuous and, some would say, seamless.

\#\# Integration under strain: lessons for Neuropsychology

\- Neuropsychological disorders show that consciousness can bed or shrink and split but it does not tolerate break of coherence.

Example:\
- Anosognosia, partially paralyzed patients deny their paralysis.\
- People with split brains do not report any halving of their vision on the midline, each half reports seeing only half of the world yet reports that it is seeing entire world.\
- Hemineglect patients only aware of only one side of their world, and act as if only the one side of everything exists, ignoring the other side of everything when dressing, drawing or describing.

\#\# The incomparable richness of being: The complexity and informativeness of conscious experience

What makes a conscious state informative is not how many chunks of information it appears to contain but that its occurrence discriminates among billions of different states of affairs each of which might lead to different behavioural outputs.
