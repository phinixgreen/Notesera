Let\'s say smartness and capabilities of AI depend on this-\
Having enough computational power and resources to change the physical world.

Let\'s say there are three key ingredients-

1\. Algorithmic efficiency: where efficiency of algorithms allow for less power consumption and more computational output. (i.e. Algorithm A takes more time and power, where Algorithm S takes much less time and power)

2\. Energy source: which decides how long AIs will continue to function with help of available energy resources.

3\. Computational memory: the memory substrate also decides how fast computations take place. (i.e Algorithms operating on small computational memory have less computational power than algorithms operating on large computation memory)

Let us consider a few scenarios now-

1\. An ANI is efficient and has finite computational memory and energy resource. An upper limit for this narrow AI might be calculated from the upper limit of energy resource, computational memory, and efficiency combined. Since it does not have recursive self-modification capabilities it might continue on the basis of computational resources to consume the energy until it runs out.

2\. An AGI is efficient, limited in energy and computational memory at initial stage, but also has recursive self-modification ability. This could imply that with the limited resources, the AI might be able to make smart decisions to find extra energy sources and materials to convert into memory substrate. The upper limit can be hard to place on this one, because it has been supplied an extra ingredient. Because of the recursive self improvement, placing limits on the Algorithmic efficiency opens up space for probability. If the AGI runs out of energy before figuring out ways to escape the no-energy bottle, then there could be a limit placed on the AGI based on energy resources.

3\. A superintelligent entity gains the ability to take-off with finite amount of resources, computation power, memory and energy. It consumes the planet, the solar system, the other solar system, and then continues to other galaxies\... the calculable upper limit, considering there is no other superintelligent entities may correspond to the thermal potential of the known universe. Since we do not know what lies beyond the known universe, it may be extremely hard to say what the upper limit would be in that case.

I think we should start asking whether we should give AI the recursive self-improvement capabilities to the point that it might be very hard to contain.
