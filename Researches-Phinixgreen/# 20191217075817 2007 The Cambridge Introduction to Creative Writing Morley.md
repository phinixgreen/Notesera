\#\# Composition and Creative Writing

\> \"Your job is eventually to create your own principles, and to test yourself\
against accepted ones. Your job, if you like, is to turn the earth of language over\
and create a fresh approach to making literature. That is literary tradition: it\
is read and reread. And it is red in tooth and claw. It is always open space.\"

\#\#\# Rules of Engagement

What are the rules by which you write? Make at least fifteen of your own. Be honest with yourself.

Now take each of those rules and write a short statement of no more than twenty words justifying each rule. Use these rules of engagement to create your works, and keep this improving as you go.
