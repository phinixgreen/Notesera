# Argument Machine Functionalism and Productivity

Functionalism + CCTM = Machine Functionalism

Probabilistic Automaton

-   Machine states
-   Memory Tape

Functional States are computational States

Computational states and Machine table states are note the same.

-   Computational State (I,O, Machine States)
-   Machine States (Arrays of Machine States)

Functional states cannot be Machine States

MF is based on Probabilistic Automaton

MF must be based on Computational States and not Machine states only.

-   Therefore
-   Computational States need

1.  Machine states
2.  Memory tape for I,O

For specific input, there is a specific output and for that a corresponding machine state(s) will be assigned.

MF Computational states, if imagined as Turing machine, in a conversation, has to be programmed with exact machine table, which will lead to finite machine states. The diverse the Input, Output combination the more memory will be needed. In this case the machine state has to have a huge machine table of states, and for each specific states, almost infinite amount of memory will be required.

In case of regular conversation, we produce finite propositions with infinite possibilities. This implies that, we can with finite memory and vocabulary, imagine almost infinite propositions. In conversation, the inputs are diverse, and we do not need specific machine state for each input. We can produce propositions based on the existing vocabulary we have.

In case of MF Computational States, the states have to be preprogrammed. Nothing can be conceived beyond the programmed states. But organisms capable of thoughts do not come with preprogrammed states, yet they can entertain infinite propositions.
