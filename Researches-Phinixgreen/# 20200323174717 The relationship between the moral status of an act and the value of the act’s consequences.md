\#\#\# The relationship between the moral status of an act and the value of the act's consequences

\#\# About This Entry

\*

This is a reflection on the relationship between the moral status of an act and the value of the act's consequences

\#\# Reflection

\#\# Deontology

Deontology or Duty Ethics is all about performing the duty.

\#\# Moral Status of Act

If the duty requires an act, then it is moral to perform the duty, without considering the feeling or relationships involved.

\#\# Value of Consequence

In Deontology, duty is more important than the consequences, therefore, the value of consequences is less than the moral status of an act performed out of moral obligation or duty.

\#\# The Relationship between \*\*\*Moral Status of an Act\*\*\* and \*\*\*the Value of its Consequences\*\*\*

In a critical perspective, the moral status is absolute in deontology while consequences are secondary. The act must be good in itself, and whatever the consequence, the act itself justifies the end. Whereas, the ends cannot and should not, according to deontology, justify the means. In other words, the consequence cannot justify the act, but the act can justify the consequences.
