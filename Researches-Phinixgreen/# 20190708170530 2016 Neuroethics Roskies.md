\# Neuroethics

\#\#\# Definition:

\> "Neuroethics is an interdisciplinary research area that focuses on ethical issues raised by our increased and constantly improving understanding of the brain and our ability to monitor and influence it, as well as on ethical issues that emerge from our concomitant deepening understanding of the biological bases of agency and ethical decision-making." - \\(Roskies, 2016\\)

\#\#\#\# Keywords \\(1\\)

\* Bioethics\
\* Neuroscience\
\* Neurotechnologies

\> " Neuroethics is driven by neurotechnologies: it is concerned with the ethical questions that attend the development and effects of novel neurotechnologies, as well as other ethical and philosophical issues that arise from our growing understanding of how brains give rise to the people that we are and the social structures that we inhabit and create."- \\(Roskies, 2016\\)

\#\#\#\# Keywords \\(2\\)

\* Liberty\
\* Freedom\
\* Agency\
\* Privacy

\#\#\# Autonomy

\> "Autonomy is the freedom to be the person one wants to be, to pursue one's own goals without unjustifiable hindrances or interference, to be self-governing."--- \\(Roskies, 2016\\)\
\>\
\> "The ability to directly manipulate our brains to control our thoughts or behavior is an obvious threat to our autonomy."--- \\(Roskies, 2016\\)\
\>\
\> "... stimulating certain brain areas in animals will lead to repetitive and often stereotyped behaviors."--- \\(Roskies, 2016\\)

\#\#\# Mind-reading

\> "Despite the remarkable advances in brain imaging technology, however, when it comes to mental content, our current abilities to "mind-read" are relatively limited \\(Roskies 2015a\\)."--- \\(Roskies, 2016\\)

\#\#\#\# Keywords \\(3\\)

\* Neuroimaging

\#\#\# BCI

\> "Brain computer interfaces \\(BCIs\\)... are systems that read brain activity and use it to guide robotic prostheses for limbs, or to move a cursor on a video screen \\(Lebedev and Nicolelis 2006; Wolpaw et al. 2000\\)." --- \\(Roskies, 2016\\)\
\>\
\> "BCIs raise another neuroethical issue: our conception of humanity and our relations to machines."--- \\(Roskies, 2016\\)\
\>\
\> "some find this an ethically unproblematic natural extension of our species' characteristic drive to invent and improve our selves with technology \\(Clark 2004\\), others fear that creating a bio-cybernetic organism raises troubling questions about the nature or value of humanity, about the bounds of self, or about Promethean impulses \\(Attiah and Farah 2014; Sandel 2009\\)." --- \\(Roskies, 2016\\)

\#\#\# Belief in Free Will

\> "A number of neuroscientists and psychologists have intimated or asserted that neuroscience can show or has shown that free will is or is not an illusion \\(Brembs 2011; Libet et al. 1983; Soon et al. 2008; Wegner 2003\\). Others have countered with arguments to the effect that such a demonstration is in principle impossible \\(Roskies 2006\\)." ---\\(Roskies, 2016\\)

\#\#\#\# Keywords \\(4\\)

\* Personal identity\
\* Self\
\* Social and Legal identity\
\* Psychological Continuity\
\* Bodily integrity\
\* Authenticity\
\* Self identification

\#\#\# Narrative Self

\> "what is important is the ability to create a coherent narrative, or "narrative self" \\(Schechtman 2014\\)."---\\(Roskies, 2016\\)\
\>\
\> "the ability to create and sustain a coherent narrative in which we are the protagonist and with which we identify is a measure of psychological health \\(Waters and Fivush 2015\\)."---\\(Roskies, 2016\\)\
\>\
\> "...how do we evaluate the costs and ethical issues attending a dramatic change in personality? If neurointerventions promise to result in dramatic shifts in a person's values and commitments, whose interests should take priority if one person must be favored---the original or the resulting person? The relevance of personhood, self, agency, identity and identification needs further elaboration for neuroethics."---\\(Roskies, 2016\\)

\#\#\#\# Scholars \\(1\\)

\* Derek Parfit

\#\#\#\# Keywords \\(5\\)

\* Neural prostheses

\#\#\# Hard Problem of Consciousness

\> "The Hard Problem of consciousness \\(namely, how to explain the qualitative character of experience, or "what it is like" to have a particular experience, see e.g., Chalmers 1995\\) has yielded little to the probings of neuroscience, and it is not clear whether it ever will." ---\\(Roskies, 2016\\)

\#\#\# Law and Neuroethics

\> "neuroethics stretches seamlessly into the law \\(see, e.g., Vincent 2013; Morse and Roskies 2013\\)." ---\\(Roskies, 2016\\)
