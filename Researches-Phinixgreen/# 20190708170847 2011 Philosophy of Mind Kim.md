\# Mind as a Computing Machine - Machine Functionalism

"Psychological Predicates" \\(1967\\) by Hilary Putnam led to the fall of Physicalism \\(namely Psychoneural Identity Theory\\) and the rise of the functionalism.

This was largely because of the idea of \_\*\*Multiple Realizability of Mental Properties\*\*\_

\#\# Multiple Realizability and the Functional Conception of Mind

\> \*\*The Thesis of Physicalism:\*\* \_"anything that exhibits mentality must be a physical system"\_ \\(Kim, 2011\\)

This means-

\> \_"Only physical systems such as biological organisms are capable of having mental properties."\_

\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*

{% hint style=\"info\" %}\
\*\*Thoughts\*\*

What if a robot or an alien has the mental properties that is similar to biological organism? In that case, it must be that, having a biological system is not a necessary requirement for having mental properties. So is that mentality is \_Substrate Independent\_?\
{% endhint %}

\#\#\# \*\*Functionalism\*\*

We sometimes define object according to the job they perform rather than the things they are composed of.

Engines can have different configurations. But they all do the same thing. Similarly, mind can have different states and content. But they do similar thing. They process information.

\#\#\# Computational View of Mentality

\> "A computational view of mentality also shows that we must expect mental states to be multiply realized." \\(Kim 2011\\)

\* Two computers can have two different computational states, but still they can have similar basic computation operating at the bottom of these states.\
\* If the mind is a cognitive machine, and cognition is itself a computational process at the bottom, then two minds can have different states, but the basic neural computation process can still be similar in kind.

\*\* \` \"What does pain in humans, pain in canines and pain in aliens have in common?\" \` \*\*

\> \_\*\*Physicalist's Response:\*\*\_ \*\*\*\*Pain is a physical event. They are all having the same physical state. \_\_

\> \_\*\*Behaviourist's Response:\*\*\_ Pain has a common behavioural property. They are all in pain because they exhibit similar Pain-Behaviour. \_\_

\> \_\*\*Functionalist's Response:\*\*\_ Pain is a set of input-output that defines that there is function going on inside these entities. And these functions are similar and this \*\*functional state\*\* is a \*\*mental state\*\* which is \*\*multiply realisable.\*\*

Perks of Accepting Functionalism: 1. There can be multiple reason for activating a functional state \\(AKA Mental State such as Pain state\\) 2. Output of a functional state can be another functional state \\(Pain can activate another mental state\\)

\#\#\# Difference Between Functionalism and Behaviourism

Both theories talk of mental states in terms of "stimulus" and "response" BUT there are differences in how they see mental events and states

\#\#\#\# \_Functionalism\_ \\(Mental Realism\\)

\* explains mental states through a \*\*Realist Analysis\*\*\
\* It cares about not only the function but also the causal relationship that causes it

Ex: I can be in pain. Why am I in pain. Pain because I tripped. When I tripped, some of my skin tissues were damaged. It all led to me suddenly screaming in pain.

\* takes into account the fact that, mental states can cause other mental states as well, so not just behaviours but mental states can lead to other behaviour and mental states.\
\* Takes a Mental Realist position that mental events are real ontological phenomenon.

\#\#\#\# \_Behaviourism\_

\* explains mental states through an\*\*Instrumental Analysis\*\*\
\* It cares only about the actual or possible behaviour and not the internal states of an organism

Ex: I am in pain. I tripped. And am screaming now. Since I am screaming, I must be in pain.

\* assumes that inputs and outputs are always observable, in other words, only behaviour leads to other behaviour.

\#\#\#\# \*\*Box:\*\* \_\*\*Instrumentalist analysis and Realist analysis\*\*\_

How do you know sugar is soluble in water?

\> \*\*Realist:\*\* \_\"Immerse the sugar in water, and its particles change its state because of its chemical properties which leads to the sugar dissolving in water.\"\_

\> \*\*Instrumentalist:\*\* \"\_If you immerse sugar in water, it dissolves.\"\_

\#\#\#\# Holistic concept of mentality

\_I want to eat an apple when there is an apple presented to me and I think it is really an apple.\_ \*\*Behaviourism\*\* has trouble connecting the network of desires and beliefs that lead to a final behaviour. But \*\*Functionalism\*\* offers holistic concept of mentality saying that \_I will eat an apple when overall circumstances permit me and the holistic status of my mental states leads to the behaviour of eating an apple.\_

But this is a kind of circular definition.
