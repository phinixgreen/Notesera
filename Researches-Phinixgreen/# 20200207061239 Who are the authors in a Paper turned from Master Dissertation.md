 > "The basis of the writing team will be formed by the dissertation supervisor and the student. If the supervisor is confident of developing a dissertation, with the help of the student providing additional information, a two coauthor paper should suffice. Often a supervisor wants to include an additional academic who has publishing experience to help with the development of the paper (Table 4). This can be of considerable help to the dissertation supervisor who might have a heavy teaching load and little time to work on a paper or wants a member of staff with publishing experience to craft the paper for publication and who has expert knowledge of the publication process with certain journals through having experience of being on editorial advisory boards." (Thomas & Skinner, 2012)

According to Thomas and Skinner (2012), the writing team of the dissertation to journal paper can be formed by the Dissertation Student and Dissertation Supervisor. Sometimes, a second academic is invited, who has publishing experience to help with the development of the paper in case the supervisor has heavy workload or otherwise wants to include the member of staff to contribute to the paper publishing.

Thomas and Skinner (2012) recommends the following team formation-
