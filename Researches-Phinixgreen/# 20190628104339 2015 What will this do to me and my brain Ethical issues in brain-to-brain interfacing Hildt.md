# Summary

This paper provides that direct information transfer between two brains may lead to "the development of new approaches involving memory, emotions or senses" (Hildt, 2015)

This may raise many novel ethical concerns.

## Introduction

BBI explained: A mechanism for "direct communication between two brains that does not involve any activity of the peripheral nervous system."

## Recent Experiments (pp.1-2)

-   "Yoo et al. (2013) established functional links between the brain of a human volunteer and the brain of a rat. "

-   "Pais-Vieira et al. (2013) used a BBI to transfer behaviorally meaningful sensorimotor information from the brain of one rat (the "encoder" rat) to the brain of another rat (the "decoder" rat). "

-   "The authors go on to state that these results "indicate that animal brain dyads or even brain net- works could allow animal groups to synchronize their behaviors following neuronal-based cues." (Pais-Vieira et al., 2013, p. 6)."

-   "Grau et al. (2014) provided the first example of conscious transmission of information between humans via a non-invasive BBI based on a BCI using motor imagery-controlled electroencephalography and a CBI that used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to induce the conscious perception of phosphenes, i.e., the experience of seeing light. "

-   "Yoo et al. (2013, p. 7) assume that "if both BCI and CBI are implemented between two awake human subjects, the information flow could be made bidirectional and communicative between apperceptive identities/individuals.""

-   "Possible future applications beyond the laboratory that have been envisioned include the use of BBIs in the military or in other professional contexts where they may allow for silent commands or may serve to synchronize behavior of a larger group of individuals."

## Need for Ethical Reflection (p.2)

> "What makes BBIs unique, however, is the transfer of information representing specific mes- sages directly from one brain to another, without involving any activity of the peripheral nervous system or senses. On the side of the recipient, BBIs involve a form of information input not seen so far. " (Hidlt, p.2)

-   Hildt raises the question of "shared control" (Tamburrini, 2009) between BBI users and who might be held responsible for an action.

-   "Being part of a brain--brain dyad or a multi-brain system may also have complex repercussions on a person's concept of self, and raises questions concerning self-perception, individuality and body ownership (Hildt, 2011)"

-   "Will it be possible to clearly separate one's concept of self and the other? "

## Implications for the Receipient (p.2-3)

-   The recipient will probably not be responsible for the information received in unidirectional BBI as seen in (Yoo et al. 2013). But the recipient will also not be able to distinguish between his own motor movements and input stimuli from outside nodes if multiple stimuli is given recurrently and continuously. He may erroneously ascribed authorship of these actions to himself.

> "a BBI was able to elicit different types of emotions or memories. In a hypothetical situation where a BBI transmits a memory code that makes the recipient recall seeing a blue ball, the recipient may be clearly aware of the fact that his recurrent recalling of a blue ball may result from a BBI whose sole function is to elicit this urge."

-   BBI can trigger emotions from received memories.

> "in a scenario of memory transfer in humans, similar to the experiment in rats carried out by Deadwyler et al. (2013), the recipient would end up having two types of memories: his own genuine memories and the quasi-memories1 transferred via the BBI technology. However, he would not be able to distinguish between his own genuine memories and the quasi- memories."

-   In case of memory transfer, the recipient will not be able to distinguish between genuine memories and received memories. `Thoughts: An algorithm protocol may be deployed to keep track of memory transfer. But such protocol monitoring is probably unrealistic in expectation as it will require further external memory drives.`

> " In view of this, the recipient's sense of identity would be highly questioned \[cf. the philosophical debate run by Shoemaker (1970), Williams (1976), Parfit (1984), and others\]. "

## Conclusion(p.4)

> "One of the central questions is whether there actually is a need for direct brain-to-brain communication."

> "in view of the complex ethical implications arising in the BBI recipient described above, the spectrum of possible ethically acceptable BBIs seems rather limited."
