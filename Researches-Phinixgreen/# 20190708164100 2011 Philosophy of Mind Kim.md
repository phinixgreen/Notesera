\# Machine Functionalism

Machine Functionalism

According to Kim \\(2011, p.147\\) "Machine functionalists claim that we can think of the mind as a Turing machine \\(or a probabilistic automaton\\)." Putnam\'s Probabilistic Automata is similar to Turing machines but are not deterministic in their transition from one state to another. He explains that ---

"The operations of a probabilistic automaton are not deterministic; the current internal state of the machine and the symbol it is scanning do not---do not always, at any rate---together uniquely determine what the machine will do next." \\(Kim 2011, p.144\\)

Thus, a mental activity, according to Putnam is a Probabilistic Automaton. He connects this to CCTM by proposing that machine states are also part of the automaton, therefore, a machine state can either lead to an output or another machine state.

According to Kim \\(2011, p.151\\) Machine Functionalism proposes- "What it is for an organism, or system, to have a psychology---that is, what it is for an organism to have mentality---is for it to realize an appropriate Turing machine" and even "makes the stronger claim that its having a machine description of an appropriate kind is constitutive of its mentality." \\(Kim 2011, p.151\\)

In other word, Machine Functionalism claims that an organism or a system to has mentality, if it has inner psychology / intentionality and which is constituted by the Turing machine. Thus, "Mentality, or having a mind, consists in being a physical computer that realizes a Turing machine of appropriate complexity and powers. What makes us creatures with mentality, therefore, is the fact that we are Turing machines" \\(Kim, 2011, p.151\\). Therefore, in this view, it is not the physical brain that is the mind, it is the computations going on in the physical substances--- that is the mind.
