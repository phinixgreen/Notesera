> A BBI is based on the joint mechanism of the capacity to read (decode) information from neural activitiy and the capacity to write (encode) information back to neural activity (Stocco et al. 2014, p.1)

> In the encoder part of a BBI, various nerual activity capturing devices such as implanted electrodes, electrocorticography, electroencephalography and fucntional MRI are implemented to decode motor, visual and conceptual information from the brain. (Stocco et al. 2014, p.1)

> In the decoder part of a BBI, stimulation techniques such as implanted electrodes, transcranial magnetic stimulation, focused ultrasound, cochlear implant and deep brain stimulators are used to transfer encoded information to the brain.

> The experiment by Stocco et al. (2014, p.11) where two humans cooperatively performed a task using only a direct brain to brain interface (BBI) as a channel of communication established the fact that information extracted from one brain can be transmitted to another brain.

> The authors conclude that this mechanism has the potential to revolutionize how humans communicate and collaborate (Stocco et al. 2014, p.11)
