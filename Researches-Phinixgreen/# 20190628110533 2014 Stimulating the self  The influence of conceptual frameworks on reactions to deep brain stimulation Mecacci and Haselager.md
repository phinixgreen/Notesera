-   The authors argue that DBS-induced maladaptations might be partially caused by a conceptual emphasis on Brain Centric materialism which is also known as \"Neuroessentialism\" (Roskies 2002; Reiner 2011; )

-   Johnson (2008) has shown that majority of population believes in some kind of dualistic ontology about mind and brain being separated substances.

-   The authors argue that this existing dualistic ontological beliefs are rooted in neuroessentialism and that maladaptations happen when this beliefs are challenged.

-   Maladaptive symptoms include behavioral / psychological alterations (Klaming and Haselager 2013)
