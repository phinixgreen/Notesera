Mind as Causal System

Kim maintains that Functionalist definitions- "can accommodate the phenomenon of multiple realization of mental states." (Kim, 2010, p. 176)

"Mental phenomena are conceived as nodes in a complex causal network that engages in causal transactions with the outside world at its peripheries, by receiving sensory inputs and emitting behavior outputs." (Kim, 2010, p.169)

"Central to any version of functionalism is the idea that a mental state can be characterized in terms of the input-output relations it causally mediates, where the inputs and outputs may include other mental states as well as sensory stimuli and physical behaviors." (Kim, 2010, p.169)

"Viewed as a definition of what it is to be a mental state, this is obviously circular. To circumvent the threatened circularity, machine functionalism exploits the concept of a Turing machine in characterizing mentality. To achieve the same end, causal-theoretical functionalism exploits the entire network of causal relations involving all psychological states---in effect, a comprehensive psycho- logical theory---to anchor the physical-behavioral definitions of individual mental properties."(Kim, 2010, p.170)

Realizer Functionalism- The function pain can be realized in multiple physical realisers, i.e. pain in humans, reptiles, octopuses, C-fiber firing.

Role Functionalism- The function pain can be realized as a causal role between other states such as detecting tissue damage and triggering appropriate behaviour as response.

Advocates of role functionalism, according to Kim, argue that, role functionalism provides causal understanding about what systems do and interact without taking into consideration the micro-physical details of the physical realiser.

"The functionalist claim is often expressed by assertions like "Mental states are causal roles" and "Mental properties (kinds) are functional properties (kinds)." "(Kim, 2010, p. 183)

Disjunction and Second Order Properties

" Mental property M is the property of having a property with causal specification H. As a rule, the functionalist believes in the multiple realizability of mental properties: For every mental property M, there will in general be multiple properties, Q1, Q2, . . . , each meeting the causal specification H ---that is, the Qs are the realizers of M---it would seem to follow that M is identical with the disjunctive property of having Q1 or Q2

...

a property defined the way M is defined is often called a "second-order" property; in contrast, the Qs, their realizers, are "first-order" properties."

"Most philosophers who believe in the multiple realizability of mental properties deny that mental properties are disjunctive properties---disjunctions of their realizers" (Kim, 2010, p. 184)

"the rejection of such disjunctions as legitimate properties was at the heart of the multiple realization argument against psychoneural-type physicalism. " (Kim, 2010, p. 184)

"cognitive science properties so conceived threaten to turn out to be heterogeneous disjunctions of properties after all." (Kim, 2010, p. 184)
