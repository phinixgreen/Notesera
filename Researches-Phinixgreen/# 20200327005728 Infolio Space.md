3\. Expressing Ground

Two approaches to explaining ground\
1. Operator (connective) Approach

\*"uses an operator to join the sentences stating what gets explained to the sentences stating what does the explaining" (Raven, 2015, p.324)\*

1\. Relational (predicate) approach

\*"uses a relational predicate to join the terms referring to what gets explained and the terms referring to what does the explaining" (Raven, 2015, p.324)\*

Pure and Impure Logic of the Ground\
1. Pure Logic

\*"concerns the structural principles governing the ground operators without regard to the internal features of what they connect" (Raven, 2015, p.324)\*

1\. Impure Logic

\*"additionally concerned with these internal features (e.g. logical form)" (Raven, 2015, p.324)\*

1\. Overview\
Raven provides the outline of the paper by saying that-

The questions of grounding converge from two approaches.

1\. Why questions have to be grounded in answers\
2. How some phenomenon are 'built' on the or grounded on other fundamental phenomenon

6\. Beyond the Operator

\*"clarifying ground requires going beyond the operator and back to the relation underlying it." (Raven, 2015, p.326)\*

Raven takes the unionism perspective and says that on this view "ground is a relation of metaphysical explanation" (Raven, 2015, p.327)

\* "ground is an explanatory relation" (Raven, 2015, p.327)

Candidates for Relata (things that explains ground relations)\
\* "Events are disqualified for being too concrete" (Raven, 2015, p.327)\
\* "Objects are disqualified for being unable to give or receive explanation" (Raven, 2015, p.327)

\*"relata must concern how things are without prejudging whether they are concrete or abstract." (Raven, 2015, p.327)\*

\* Facts "have structures and constituents" (Raven, 2015, p.327)

What is Ground according to Raven?\
Is a multigrade metaphysical explanatory relation between

\* The grounded: "the facts which get explained"

and

\* The grounds: "the facts which explain them"

6.2. EXPLANATORY LOGIC\
Ground employs the following logical framework

1\. Irreflexivity: Nothing explains itself, ground doesn't explain itself\
2. Asymmetry: Grounds are not cyclical in explanation\
3. Transitivity (Cut): Establishes chains of relations\
4. Well-foundedness: Grounded facts must be grounded in facts that are ungrounded themselves\
5. Non-monoticity: Ground doesn't need to survive any arbitrary additional grounds

1-3: "entail that ground forms a strict partial ordering on facts, like a hierarchy of chains of explanation" (Raven, 2015, p.327)

4: entails that explanatory chains begin from unexplained explainers (Raven, 2015, p.327)

Ground is becoming important because it can perform roles that the other notions cannot perform. These are-

1\. Entailment: "unable because it is reflexive"\
2. Supervenience: "unable because it is not asymmetric" (Raven, 2015, p.327)\
3. Identity (reduction): "unable because it is reflexive and symmetric" (Raven, 2015, p.327)\
4. Truthmaking: "unable because it does not chain" (Raven, 2015, p.327)

5\. Linking Metaphysics to Explanation

Two View to Linking Metaphysics to Explanation\
1. Separatists: Separates \*metaphysical aspects\* to \*\*ground\*\* and \*explanatory aspects\* to \*\*metaphysical explanation\*\*\
2. Unionists: "link ground to metaphysical explanation by taking ground to be (a kind of) metaphysical explanation." (Raven, 2015, p.326)

Ground attempts to link metaphysics to explanation\
\* Metaphysics tries to answer questions independently of the world we live in\
\* Explanation are dependent on the world we live in

8\. Skeptical Challenges\
Hofweber's \*Esoteric Metaphysics\*: "one needs to understand distinctively metaphysical terms \~such as 'ground'\~ in order for one to understand what the questions are that metaphysics tries to answer. You have to be an insider to get in the door." (Raven, 2015, p.330)

1\. Outsider skeptics: "are skeptical of ground because it is esoteric" (Raven, 2015, p.330)\
2. Insider skeptics:

\* "ground is confused"\
\* "ground is irrelevant"

\*Raven proposes that -\*

\*"disentangling ground from neighboring ground-like notions and in bolstering its job description." (Raven, 2015, p.330)\*

\*"this job description can be bolstered by exploring new and fruitful applications of ground." (Raven, 2015, p.330)\*

\*"A distinctive advantage of this characterization is that it can apply even to "bottomless" scenarios in which each entity depends on yet others "all the way down""(Raven, 2015, p.330)\*

2\. Converging on Ground\
\*"The target notion of ground can also be approached as playing a role in the grand metaphysical project of explaining how some phenomena are "built" from more fundamental phenomena." (Raven, 2015, p.323)\*

The ground theory assumes that some phenomenon are built from other phenomenon and there is a certain hierarchical relationship between the top level phenomenon and the bottom level phenomena.

Whether there is a top level of phenomenon or ground-level fundamental phenomenon is beyond the scope of metaphysical answer. But the it seems there is a relationship between different ground-level phenomena and the phenomenon emerging out of it.

This relationship is assumed to be the ground.

Purpose / Importance of Grounding

\* Grounding seems to have job description and this is in relations to the virtue of questions and the structure approach.

7\. Meta-Ground\
There are two horns of dilemma

1\. Ground facts have no ground\
2. Ground facts have grounds

\*"The connectivist strategy says that a fact about such an explanatory connection helps ground the ground-fact" (Raven, 2015, p.329)\*

\*"an explanatory connection might derive from a connection between essence and ground" (Raven, 2015, p.329)\*

\* but if connective facts themselves remain ungrounded then how do they ground other grounds

4\. Models of the Ground

Remarks\
\*"in general, explanations of ground do not straightforwardly conform to these kinds of explanation, and it is unobvious whether there are other kinds to which they do. This helps explain why ground is often taken on its own terms as providing a bona fide, distinctively metaphysical kind of explanation" (Raven, 2015, p.325)\*

Non-causal explanations\
\*"modal (supervenience) explanations which explain a phenomenon by citing what necessitates it (or on what it supervenes). But necessitation (supervenience) alone does not provide a ground explanation since ground explanations are hyperintensional whereas modal explanations are not." (Raven, 2015, p.325)\*

\*"mathematical explanation, which is often supposed to be both noncausal and hyperintensional. Mathematical proof is often taken to be central to mathematical explanation (Hafner and Mancosu \~2005\~ ), with some taking proof to be explanatory only if the proof proceeds from the essence of the entities it concerns (Steiner \~1978\~ ). But mathematical proof would seem neither necessary nor sufficient for ground." (Raven, 2015, p.325)\*

\*"it might be doubted whether any exclusively apriori or any exclusively aposteriori kind of explanation will be a good model. For it seems we wish to allow that what grounds what might turn on a mixture of apriori and aposteriori considerations." (Raven, 2015, p.325)\*

Causal Explanation\
\*"Causal explanation appears importantly disanalogous to explanations of ground." (Raven, 2015, p.325)\*

Why causal Explanation is disanalogous to explanation of ground?

Reason 1-

\*"First, ground explanations needn't involve the traditional hallmarks of causal explanation, such as a transference of power, or a non-trivial statistical relationship, or even an asymmetric counterfactual dependence, between the explaining causes and the explained effects." (Raven, 2015, p.325)\*

\*"For example, given that a conjunction is grounded in its conjuncts, no power is transferred from either to the other, either is as likely to obtain as the other, and each would obtain were the other to obtain." (Raven, 2015, p.325)\*

Reason 2-

\*"Second, there can be ground explanations without causal explanations." (Raven, 2015, p.325)\*

\*"For example, the question can intelligibly be raised which one of two necessary facts (e.g. a mathematical axiom and a theorem) outside the causal order might ground the other, even though there can be no causal explanation of the one by the other. For another example, the question of whether causality is grounded in the Humean mosaic \~...\~ ) is not a question of causal explanation." (Raven, 2015, p.325)\*

6.3. METAPHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS\
Ground has metaphysical characteristics

1\. Necessity: "since grounds determine what they ground, the obtaining of the grounds necessitate what they ground" (Raven, 2015, p.328)\
2. Internality: The grounds and the grounded are related so it is necessary that grounds ground the grounded (Raven, 2015, p.328)

Essentiality: The relation of ground comes from the nature of constituents of grounds and the grounded or both (Raven, 2015, p.328)
