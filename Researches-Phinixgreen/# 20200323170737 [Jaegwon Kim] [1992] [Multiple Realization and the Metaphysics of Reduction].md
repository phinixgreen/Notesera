Multiple Realisation and the metaphysics of Reduction

Kim states the thesis of multiple realisation (MR)--- that any mental state such as pain is capable of being realized, instantiated or implemented by widely diverse neurological-biological structures in humans, reptiles and molluscs, and "perhaps other organisms further removed from us." (Kim, 1992, p.1)

MR rejects psychophysical reduction, particularly Smart's Identity theory.

Kim takes stance against the MR thesis. He goes on to say that -"there is something right and instructive in the antireductionist claim based on MR and the basic argument in its support" but that philosophers have failed to appreciate the full significance of its implications.

He suggests that autonomous special science, a doctrine promoted by "MR-inspired antireductionist dialectic" may be inconsistent with real implications of MR.

II\. Multiple Realization

Kim refers to Putnam introducing the MR in the mind-body debate in 1967 (Kim, 1992, p.9).

Kim states that Putnam questioned the empirical basis of the correlation thesis and later had stressed that MR of Mental as an a priori conceptual point which views psychological properties as "Second-order" physical properties. Kim stresses that the second-order physical properties does not include constraints on their physical implementation.

Kim initially argues that this leads to the what he calls a Structure-Restricted Correlation (SRC) Thesis or the Restricted Correlation Thesis.

The SRC implies that there is a "multiplicity of neural-physical kinds" that realises sensations such as pain.

Kim stresses that the realisation thesis does not metaphysically describe how mental properties are ontologically realised or implemented by physical properties and how they interact.

Kim proposes that realisation could also occur locally (LR), as in inter-species realisation, pain in humans, reptiles and martians. In attempt to relativize the SRC and LR, Kim proposes that the psychological states of the physical realizer is allowed by its disjunctive properties.

The disjunctive property can be described as follows:

if P is physical properties of the realisers and M is the mental instantiations of the physical then,

P \<---\> M

Kim argues that Microstructure does affect the realisation of properties of macrostructure. If the mental kinds do indeed supervene on physical realisers then similar mental kind should be realized in similar microstructure. But properties of microstructure affects properties of macrostructure. Then physical realisers should have something in common when they experience the mental kind pain.

Kim argues that "If psychological properties are multiply realized then so is psychology itself" hence " multiple local reduction, rather than global reductions... are possible" (Kim, 1992, p. 21)

Kim argues for reductionism.
