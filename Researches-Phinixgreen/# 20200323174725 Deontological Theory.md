\#\# Deontological Theory

Deontology or Duty Ethics focuses on duties, or moral obligations rather than the consequences of an action. I will focus on Kantianism as an example of Deontology. For Kantianists, this would mean we should do good thing because it is our duty to do so and not otherwise. How does a Kantian know what one \*ought to do\*? Only acts that are universalizable or acts that would not be a problem if everyone did that are good. When performing these duties, a Kantian knows that one has to be impartial if the duty requires us so. Of course, this does not mean we do not care for our loved ones. But as a Kantian, we love our loved ones because it is our duty to do so, and that is universalizable as well. Furthermore, as a Kantian, we do not use people to achieve something, even that is something good. To put it another way, doing wrong to achieve something good is not aligned with Kantian principle. A duty is always morally good, therefore a duty cannot harm anyone to achieve something better. As a deontology, Kantianism respects people as individuals. The duties are not too demanding as well. So as Kantians, we need not to help everyone in the world. A Kantian would prefer to say everyone has a duty towards others and that if everyone helped each other, then the world would automatically be a better place.
