1\. Is human right too expensive?

\`What is Human Rights\`

\`For whom is it expensive\`

\* William Easterly (2009) argues against the human right to health as a basis for health care, for two reasons:

\* Claim 1: \"Human Rights to Health Diverts resources to those who shout the loudest and have the best connections, so increases inequality and distorts cost-effective planning\" (p.227)

\* Wolff agrees that this true of wealthy and middle-income countries.

\* \"that those who pursue human rights claims are likely to be wealthy, or at least in some sense privileged and well-connected.\" (p.227)\
\* Examples:\
1. British NHS: Denial to provide Breast Cancer drug considered to be violation of human rights to life. Case won.\
2. South Africa: Denial to provide dialysis to kidney failure patient due to prioritization. Case won.\
3. Brazil: Denial to access to treatment come to court and win the cases.\
\* Conclusion: \"It is not the richest either- they can pay for their own medication- but the articulate or well connected middle classes (Ferraz 2009)\" (p.229)

\* Cases for poorer countries

\* Access to HIV treatment/medicine ARV Examples:\
1. Mozambique: It is not cost effective for Mozambique to supply drugs because currency related prices vary due to international currency exchange. To maintain the health service would mean that the country would have to abandon all other development sector budget.

\* Cases for Developing world:

\* access to treatment: \"If money provided by a donor is tied to specific purpose, then it is simply not available for other purposes.\"(p.232)\
\* it is then corruption that makes healthcare look expensive not the actual issue.

Cases:

\* Maternal mortality It has been argued by Yamin and Maine (1999) that women all over the world suffer similar problems during delivery.\
1. Cheaper support can be provided but it would not reduce the maternal mortality rate.\
2. Proper support must be in place to reduce maternal mortality.\
If right to health is expensive, and should not be the basis of healthcare, then this implies that campaigns for reducing maternal mortality makes no sense.

\* It seems some countries cannot afford better medical healthcare because of the global economic order. It is then

\* Wolff argues that \"surely the most promising strategy is a human rights approach which puts duties on the international community to assist those counties that cannot, on their own, meet their \'core human right tot heath obligations\'\" (p.232)

Conclusion: While the notion of cost-effectiveness is vital for rational distribution of extensive, but nevertheless, limited health resources in the wealthy world, it is hugely damaging if used as a test for access in health care policy in the poorest countries of the world.
