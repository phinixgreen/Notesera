\# Probabilistic Automata

Probabilistic Automata

According to Putnam \\(1975, p. 433\\) "The notion of a Probabilistic Automaton is defined similarly to a Turing Machine, except that the transitions between \'states\' are allowed to be with various probabilities rather than being \'deterministic'." In a generalised view of probabilistic Automaton, specific sets of sensory inputs are specified by 'every possible combination' of initial state and a distinct set of 'sensory inputs'. An instruction determines the probability of the following state and also the probabilities of 'motor outputs'.
