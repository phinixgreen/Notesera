In the previous chapter, I have provided scientific evidence that it is highly likely that Brain to Brain Interfacing could impact our cognition. In this chapter I will argue that this will impact our idea of selfhood and personal identity.

One way to begin is to accept the possibility that Brain to Brain Interfacing will be massively used. For the ease of analysis, I will argue that two brains when connected will acts as one brain with two perspectival self gradually merged.

Let us think of two hypothetical individual Allen and Zeta, who happen to have access to each other through a brain to brain interfacing mechanism.

Before BBI, I argue that Allen and Zeta were two individuals, but after BBI, Allen and Zeta are not individuals Allen or individual Zeta but a single individual with the characteristic of both Allen and Zeta.

A simple test is to call out their name when in public. From a third person perspective Allen and Zeta are two separate individuals. Thus one might be tempted to call Allen - Allen and Zeta - Zeta. However, calling either Allen or Zeta could make both physical part of Allen and physical part of Zeta turn their head. This simple thought experiment could hint that although they are physically discrete, mentally they are both Allen and Zeta.

This is ofcourse on the base assumption that Allen and Zeta were born as discrete individuals, had a distinct self identity and later merged into both Allen and Zeta.

Consider the case of Bart. Bart is merger of two unnamed babies, who were given brain to brain access to each other before they were given distinct social identity. As a result, Bart is a single individual with extended bodies. As bizarre as it seems, Bart can be in two places at the same time, talk to different people simultaneously. So for a person who knows that there two Bart bodies lived my one Bart mind, this will not make much difference, but for a person who is not aware, this could cause much confusion. Let\'s assume the Bart body 1 is physically distinct than Bart body 2. But they are the same person sharing the same memory and emotions. For a person who met Bart body 1 and gave him an information about Amazon sales, meeting Bart body 2 who would greet that person again for sharing the Amazon sales information earlier would perplex him.

Should we call
