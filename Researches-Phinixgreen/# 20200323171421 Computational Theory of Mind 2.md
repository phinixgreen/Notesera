The Computational Theory of Mind hold that the mind is literally a computer. What is a computer? A computer is kind of Turing machine, which can recognise problems in form of arranged symbols, manipulate the syntactic properties of these symbols, perform computation and thus provides solution to the problem. If one sees the mind as a computer, it means that all our thoughts and feelings are just outcome of computational states of tiny little computers.\
Strong supporters of Turing machines holds that the mind is a Turing machine itself.

Also, if brain states are computational states then Brain states can be multiply realised, meaning two or more entities can have same tokens of computational states. However, it seems brain states are able to manipulate the semantic properties of symbols, whereas Turing machines only manipulate syntactic properties of symbols.
