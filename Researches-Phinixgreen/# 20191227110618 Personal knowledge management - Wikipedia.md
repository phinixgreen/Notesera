\#\# Notes\
Reflect how you operate and improve your system. Learn something everyday, and learn with an end in mind. Know where to look for what information, and how to record these information. Know who knows what and will be able to help you. Learn to see and understand information and how complex systems work. Hoarding information does not help if you do not understand, or learn something from them.

Here is an easy way to remember the most important points of note-taking:

\* Record: During the lecture, write all meaningful information legibly.

\* Reduce: After the lecture, write a summary of the ideas and facts using key words as cue words. Summarising as you study helps to: Clarify meanings and relationships of ideas Reinforce continuity Strengthen memory retention Prepare for exams in advance

\* Recite: To study properly, you must recite all the information in your own words without looking at our notes or the text.\
\* Reflect: Think about your own opinions and ideas as you read over your notes. Raise questions, then try to answer them creatively. Record original ideas in your notebook and review them regularly. Use your creative ideas when answering exam questions, in classroom discussions, and when writing papers.\
\* Review: Before reading or studying new material, take ten minutes to quickly review your older notes. Skim over the main ideas and details. Review enhances your retention of old material while adding new material to your memory.\
