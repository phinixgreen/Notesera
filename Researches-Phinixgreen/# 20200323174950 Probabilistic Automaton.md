\"The notion of a Probabilistic Automaton is defined similarly to a Turing Machine, except that the transitions between \'states\' are allowed to be with various probabilities rather than being \'deterministic\'. (Of course, a Turing Machine is simply a special kind of Probabilistic Automaton, one with transition probabilities o, 1). I shall assume the notion of a Probabilistic Automaton has been generalized to allow for 'sensory inputs\' and \'motor outputs\' - that is, the Machine Table specifies, for every possible combination of a \'state1 and a complete set of 'sensory inputs\', an \'instruction\' which determines the probability of the next \'state\', and also the probabilities of the \'motor outputs'." (Putnam, 1975, p. 433-434 )
