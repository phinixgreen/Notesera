- What are the evidences that are used to make judgements about a person\'s personal identity?

\#\# What are the metaphysical question about numerical Identity?\
- What makes someone who was 15 and now 50 years old the same person?

\#\# What are the historical Views of Personal Identity?\
- Historically there have been three answers personal identity\
1. Personal identity in terms of continuation of immaterial substance or soul\
2. Personal Identity in terms of continuation of Psychological continuity\
2. Personal Identity in terms of biological continuity

\#\#\# What are the Arguments for and their Limitations of Personal Identity Through continuation of soul?

This kind of approach sees the soul as the basis for the continuation of personal identity. It tackles the persistence question by positing that the soul is unchanging thus the identity of a person embodied by a soul persists. A commonplace reply to this approach is that the interaction and existence between immortal soul and physical person cannot be proven. Thus, if someone expresses skepticism whether there is a new soul embodying someone instead of the old soul, there is no way to prove it. Again, I myself cannot be sure if the soul that was awake before sleep and the soul now awake after sleep is the same soul with same memories, it could be a different soul with same memories and there is no way to prove it. The sameness of soul approach is thus largely ignored by many recent scholars.

\#\#\# Psychological continuity view\
- John Locke endorsed the Psychological Continuity Views

\- John Locke claimed that personal identity should be defined on the basis of sameness of consciousness rather than sameness of substance (Schechtman 2011)

\- This view is known as the Psychological continuity view. It argues that someone\'s autobiographical memory serves the basis for personhood not their physical body. Thus, hypothetically, if A\'s brain was implanted in B\'s body, because the brain would carry autobiographical memory, the psychological continuity will allow that A to survive in B\'s body as A.

\#\#\#\# Objection to psychological continuity view\
- If autobiographical memory is the basis for personal identity then someone who has lost their autobiographical memory also has lost their personhood.\
It could be that at age 20, A remembers robbing a bank and at age 90 A does not remember robbing a bank.\
This is the transitivity problem which points out that A at 20 and A at 90 is not the same person in the Lockean criteria. The opposite could be that R thinks that he led the victory in a war as General Chadwick, where as in real the war was really lead by General Chadwick and not R. These thought experiments provide objection to the Lockean psychological continuity view by pointing out that having delusional beliefs or not remembering own past are misappropriated by the autobiographical memory criteria of the argument.

\#\#\#\# Updated Psychological continuity view

The updated psychological continuity view holds that besides autobiographical memory, genuine and overlapping chains of psychological connections are necessary for constituting personal identity.

In this view, the delusional memory problem and the transitivity problem is bypassed. If person A continues to be B and B continues to be C, then even though A remembers robbing a Bank but C does not remember robbing a Bank is essentially the same person because, A psychologically continued to C as per the new definition.

\#\#\#\# The fission objection

The updated psychological continuity view faces objection from the fission objection. In this objection, A person continues from A to B and at B, the person splits into C and D.\
If updated psychological continuity is really the case for personal identity then there are four possibilities.\
1. B is identical to C and D.\
2. B is not identity to C and D.\
3. B is identical to C\
4. B is identical to D

In case of 1. B cannot be identical to both C and D, because according to the transitivity problem, C and D cannot be identical to each other, because they are not continuation of each other.

In case of 3 and 4. it seems implausible to say that B cannot be identical to neither C and D because, both C or D has to be continuation of B.

In case of 2, if both C and D are continuation of B, then both have the requirement to be identical to B. Yet none of them are.

\#\#\#\# Response to the Fission objection\
In response to the fission objection the Psychological continuity theorists have proposed the four dimensional approach to identity. The four dimensionalist view of identity sees a person spread out over time just as a thing can be spread out over space.

In the four dimensionalist view, A person who continues from A to B and then splits into C and D is explained as follows-

The person is one person from A to B, and then BC and BD share a segment of B and are numerically identical to their own and distinct from the other. To explain how one person becomes two persons, the four dimensionalist propose that even at A there are two persons sharing one personhood and thus it is easy to become two persons at B onwards.

Four dimensionalist thus have no problem with transitivity but it struggles to explain the oddity of how an individual should have dual personhood.

\#\#\# Parfit\'s response to the Fission objection

According to Parfit (1984), identity is not important in survival but the continuity. Such Personal continuity should state that person at t2 is appropriately continuous with person at t1 and no one else is psychologically continuous with that person. Non-branching continuity includes identity, and thus identity is important to us.

\#\# What is the Biological Continuity theory?

According to the Biological Continuity theory, psychological continuity is important for us, but a human, as an animal, persists as long as a single Human organism does.
