Functionalism

Hilary Putnam in his response to the limitations of logical behaviourism and type-identity theory formulated the Machine Functionalist (Putnam, 1967) theory.

According to Logical Behaviorism mental states are behavioral dispostions. i.e. the tendency to wince when on pain. According to Type-Identity theory mental states are brain states. i.e. the pain that is experienced by the brain.

According to Functionalism, mental states are functional states. Functional states are a combination of sensory input, motor output and appropriate mental states. Only the relevant state functions with appropriate relation with input and output and other states.
