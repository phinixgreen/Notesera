\#\# Privacy

\> \"It has been widely held that certain states of sentient creatures are private, in the technical sense that their nature cannot be known by anyone other than the subject who experiences them. (Craig 1997: 127)" p.639

\> "The barriers that prevent us from enjoying one another's experiences are not natural but logical. . . . It is not conceivable that there should be people who were capable of having one another's pains. (Ayer 1940: 138-- 139, bold type added)" p.649

\#\#\# Note : Revisiting the Fusion Problem

In the Fusion problem, Subject A merge with Subject B.

According to metaphysical privacy argument, an element of subject's conscious experience, e, is metaphysically private and cannot constitute any part of another subject's conscious experience.

If, A shares all conscious experience with B and B with A, then logically we can come to the conclusion that A and B are either the same person or part of the same person.

\> ". . . the pain you are feeling -- that particular pain -- is private to you. it is yours alone, and necessarily so. No one else could have that particular pain. Of course, conceivably someone else could have a pain that felt just like your pain, but only you could have that very pain. What is true for this one pain is true for pains generally. indeed, it is true for all mental objects of experience. None of these items of experience can be shared. i cannot have your visual images or feel your tickles, for example. Your images and tickles necessarily belong to you. (Tye 2007: 24, bold type added) "

\> Metaphysical Privacy \"is a further claim that no other subject can experience my experience or sensation---a claim that does not obviously follow from the fact that no other subject can possess my experience or my sensation." (p.640)
