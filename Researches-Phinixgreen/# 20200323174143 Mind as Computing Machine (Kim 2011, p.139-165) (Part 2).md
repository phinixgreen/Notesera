This post summarises the arguments emerging from the Turing Machine and Machine Functionalism theory

1\. A Turing machine can compute any arithmetical function\
2. Then any computer can be a Turing machine if it can compute any arithmetical function\
\~Turing machine and Functionalism\~\
Turing Machine\
\* Turing machine has both input and outputs and it performs functions.\
\* Turing machine Input: Scanning / Reading the symbols on the tape\
\* Turing machine output: Printing / Writing the symbols on the tape\
\* Turing machine function: Computation of the problem\
To recap:\
Functionalism\
Functionalism is something defined according to the function it performs rather than the things it is composed of.\
Ex: Pain is a set of input-output that defines that there is function going on inside these entities.\
Comparing Turing Machine and Functionalism\
\* Turing Machine input ::: Sensory Stimuli\
\* Turing Machine output ::: Specific Behaviours in response to the Specific Stimuli\
\* Turing machine states ::: Mental States\
\* Turing computation ::: Mental Causation\
Universal Turing machine\
A Universal Turing Machine is general-purpose computer that can solve any problem and is not dedicated to any specific program.\
This means that whatever problem is given to the machine, it can provide the output to that problem, because it is programmed in that way.\
BUT\
Turing Machine functions are Deterministic\
\* We have seen that Turing machine provides only specific output to a given problem because of the nature of its machine instructions.\
That is given-\
"Given the internal state and the symbol being scanned, the immediate next operation is wholly and uniquely determined." (Kim 2011, p. 143)\
In other words, outputs are determined by the reading of symbols and given internal state. This is a Turing machine being deterministic because of its instructions\
Probabilistic / Stochastic- Automation\
"The operations of a probabilistic automaton are not deterministic; the current internal state of the machine and the symbol it is scanning do not---do not always, at any rate---together uniquely determine what the machine will do next." (Kim 2011, p.144)\
Question\
In Turing machines, "each instruction of a Turing machine is deterministic: Given the internal state and the symbol being scanned, the immediate next operation is wholly and uniquely determined." (Kim 2011, p.143). However, \*probabilistic automation\* are not deterministic. This means that - "the current internal state of the machine and the symbol it is scanning do not---do not always, at any rate---together uniquely determine what the machine will do next." (Kim 2011, p.144). What is being meant here by probabilistic automation in Turing Machines? Does it mean, that there can be multiple ways a Probabilistic Automata can solve a complex problem? That one cannot determine how the automata will solve the problem, but one can only calculate the probability of the automata's method of reaching the outcome?\
Physical Realizers of Turing machines\
\* A Turing machine having physical realizers will have\
\* Physical symbols (not symbols in the tape but actual physical objects)\
\* The machine will be able to "read" the physical symbols not just "scan" them.\
\* The internal states are also physically realized. That is functional or computational relations in the Turing machine are replaced with physical embodiments of these parameters (Kim 2011, p.145)\
"a physical realizer of a Turing machine is a physical causal mechanism that is isomorphic to the machine table of the Turing machine." (Kim 2011, p.145)\
Convergence of Physical Realizer of Turing machine and Functionalist View\
The functionalist concept is that mental states are states occupying specific causal roles (Kim 2011, p.146)\
The Physical Realizer of Turing machine is a concept of a physical state realizing an internal state of a Turing machine (Kim 2011, p.146)\
\* On functionalist view, a mental state is defined by input stimuli, output behavior and causal relation to other mental states. (Kim 2011, p.146)\
\* On physical state realizer view, a machine state is "its causal relations to inputs, outputs, and other physical realizers of the machine's internal states." (Kim 2011, p.146)\
Structuring the convergence\
1. S is a Physical system\
2. M is a Machine description of S as a Turing machine\
3. S is a realizer of M\
4. M is a machine description of S\
If\
1. M is a behavioral description of S\
2. Then, S is not a behavioral description of M\
Then M is an inner mechanism of S\
And M cannot be actually physically S\
Alternatively, M' can also be an inner mechanism of S.\
It follows that, "two physical systems that are input-output equivalent may not be realizations of the same Turing machine." (Kim 2011, p.147)\
Machine Functionalism: Motivation and Claims\
"Machine functionalists claim that we can think of the mind as a Turing machine (or a probabilistic automaton)." (Kim 2011, p.147)\
In other words, Machine Functionalists believe, a Turing machine can have mentality if it is physically realized with appropriate complexity and mental states identified by realizers of its machines states.\
"An organism has mentality just in case there is a Turing machine of appropriate complexity that is a machine description of it, and its mental-state kinds are to be identified with the physically realized internal states of that Turing machine."\
(Kim 2011, p.147)\
\* Organism O has mentality if there is a Turing machine M of appropriate complexity that makes O, S the machine description of O.\
\* Mental state kinds of Organism O = Physically realized internal state of the Turing machine.\
What is the Psychological Reality of a Turing machine\
The psychological reality of a Turing Machine is that-\
1. Internal states must be real states of the organism, with an active link to sensory input and behavioral output (Kim 2011, p.150)\
2. Only a Turing machine is the correct machine description of that organism.\
Importance of Psychological Reality\
1. Internal states of an organism have to be considered\
2. There are neural-biological mechanism that underlies psychological states, capacities and functions (Kim 2011, p.150)\
"machine functionalism proposes: What it is for an organism, or system, to have a psychology---that is, what it is for an organism to have mentality---is for it to realize an appropriate Turing machine." (Kim 2011, p.151)\
"machine functionalism makes the stronger claim that its having a machine description of an appropriate kind is constitutive of its mentality." (Kim 2011, p.151)

\"Mentality, or having a mind, consists in being a physical computer that realizes a Turing machine of appropriate complexity and powers. What makes us creatures with mentality, \*therefore, is the fact that we are Turing machines.\* \*"\* (Kim 2011, p.151)

\
\"Having a brain is important to mentality, but the importance of the brain lies exactly in its being a computing machine. It is our brain's computational powers, not its biological properties and functions, that constitute our mentality. In short, our brain is our mind because it is a computing machine, not because it is composed of the \*kind of protein-based biological stuff it is composed of."\* (Kim 2011, p.151)

Machine Functionalists argue that we are Turing machines with incredible complexity and powers.
