## What is Cognitive Neuroscience?

> **Cognitive neuroscience** is the scientific field that is concerned with the study of the [biological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology) processes and aspects that underlie [cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition),\[ [1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_neuroscience#cite_note-1)with a specific focus on the neural connections in the brain which are involved in [mental processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_process). It addresses the questions of how cognitive activities are affected or controlled by neural circuits in the brain. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_neuroscience)

In other words, Cognitive Neuroscience is the field where Neuroscientists study the underlying processes of cognition, how mental processes emerge from neural connections.

## Issues of Cognitive Neuroscience

1.  *Free Will*: Do we have free will?
2.  *Mind and Brain*: What is the relationship between mind and Brain?
3.  How can cognitive neuroscience support its conclusions?
4.  How cognitive neuroscience explains the phenomena?
5.  How to account for the notions of neural representation and neural computation?

### 1. Free Will and Causal Efficacy of the Mind

Theories:

1.  `Interactionist Dualism`: Mind interacts with the physical world but cannot explain how.
2.  `Epiphenomenalist`: Mind does not interact with body, physical world is causally closed. Cannot explain how mind can affect physical world.
3.  `Physicalism`: Physicalism implies that cognitive neuroscience can explain cognition and behavior.

### 2. Physical Mind and Nervous System

Theories:

1.  `Reductionism`: Mental properties are physical properties of the nervous system. In this view, in order to explain cognition and behavior, Cognitive Neuroscience has to find the physical properties of the nervous system that are identical to the mental properties. *Identity Theory* or **Strong Reductionism** does not sit well with multilevel mechanistic explanation.
2.  `Multiple-Realizability`: Mental properties are realized by physical properties without being identical to them. Same mental phenomenon can be realized by many physical mechanisms.
3.  `Emergentism`: Higher level physical properties emerge in nervous system in addition to their lower level physical properties. But if lower-level properties have done their work, the higher level properties are just epiphenomenon.

So the question, if the mind has free will, is intricately related to the question if there is a mind at all. Accepting that there is a mind, needs explaining that how the mind interacts with body, or emerges from it. However, theories indicate that if there is indeed a mind, it might only exist as a epiphenomenon, and therefore the mind does not have free will. This conclusion leads to the view that there is only brain for all that matters, the mind is not relevant / accessible to scientific inquiry.

### 3. Cognitive Neuroscience and Explanation of its Conclusions

Cognitive Neuroscience explains its conclusion through data collected through

-   Neuroimaging
-   Neurophysiological recording

Data must be -

Reliable: Should not support false conclusion

Valid: Should support only the conclusion they were intended to support

### 4. How does Cognitive Neuroscience Explain

> Cognitive Neuroscience explains by providing multi-level mechanisms.

**What is a Mechanism?**

> is a collection of organized components. Each component plays a role in producing a phenomenon.

**What is a Mechanistic Explanation?**

explains a phenomenon by showing how each component of the mechanism functions in relation to one another. When organized in appropriate way, they mechanism produces a phenomenon.

**\"Cognitive Neuroscience explains cognition in terms of multilevel neural mechanism.\"**

Neural systems (Cortical Areas, cerebellum, brainstem) \> Cortical columns, Nuclei \> Neural networks, neurons and their components.

If we understand the cognition and behavior of these components, we will have a mechanistic explanation of cognition and behavior.

According to Maley and Piccinini-

> nervous systems possess receptors that respond to a wide variety of physical stimuli: light, sounds, odors, pressure, and more. These receptors transduce these physical stimuli into spike trains---sequences of neuronal signals that encode information about the physical stimuli. Neural signals are transmitted to the central nervous system, where they are processed. Such processing---called neural computations---extracts information that is implicit in the signals and combines such information with internal information about the organism's needs, beliefs, and desires---all of which are also encoded as states of the central nervous system. The outputs of neural computations are updated internal states as well as motor outputs---the behaviors of the organism.
