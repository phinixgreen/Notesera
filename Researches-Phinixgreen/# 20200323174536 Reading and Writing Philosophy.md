Reading and Writing Philosophy

\*\*Summary:\*\* \
This is an adaptation of the takeaways from the lecture and notes of \[Dr. Laura Crosilla\](https://sites.google.com/view/lauracrosilla/home) on how to write a Critical Notice at the University of Birmingham on Week 3 of Academic Term 2018-2019.

\#\# \*\*The Writing Process\*\*

Writing may be daunting for many of us, but it can be dealt with systematic approaches. The following is a workflow of how to write a paper at University Level. (Skip to the bottom for an executive summary)

\#\# Read, Think, Note

Reading is essential for writing. Usually doing the three together helps in philosophy.

\#\#\#\# Reading Tips

\* Reading too much will distract you from your topic, reading too little will not help in making strong statements

\* Read less if you want to focus\
\* Read more if you want your paper to stand out and have independence

\* Make sure to Research in a targeted manner, skim and scan and, then read the supporting literature in-depth.

\#\#\#\# Thinking Tips

Narrow down the question and think while you read. Define the terms and keywords will help you in thinking.

\#\#\#\# Noting Tips

\* Take notes while you think\

\#\# \*\*Planning a draft\*\*

\#\#\#\# Planning Tips

It is always better to start planning early. Start the drafting with keeping resources ready at hand. Make sure you plan your structure first.

\#\# \*\*Writing a draft\*\*

Drafting workflow could be like this---

1\. Write more than one draft\
2. Save a copy, print out or put in a drawer\
3. Wait for two days\
4. Rewrite\
5. Compare the two drafts\
6. Decide which one to keep\
7. Repeat if needed

\#\#\#\# Outlining

You can start with writing a one-word summary of what you want to do. Then write a three word summary of how you will do it. Followed by elaborated arguments in sections. Then just fill in the sections with reflection, research and evidence.

\#\#\#\# Sections

Use sections but try not to overuse it. Also, each Section should have a distinct subtopic. For long papers, use smaller paragraphs and larger paragraphs for short papers.

\#\#\#\# Introduction

Be Concise in what you want to introduce. Then, Explain what you will argue. You could also explain what to expect. Of course, the main aim is to take a stand that (This is the problem, and I will argue that ...)

\#\#\#\# Main Body

You should explain any basic terms besides outlining the material. Explain in brief the Argument in question, so that you can argue your argument in a methodical way\
- Use topic sentences\
- Use signposting between parts of the body\
- (I have argued that now I will...)

Now you can explain if the topic argument has strong or weak points. Present an alternative if you think it\'s weak or compliment the strong points by saying why it is strong with evidence and references. Be sure to add strong objections first and provide the strongest reply to the strongest objection.\
\#\#\#\# Conclusion

The conclusion is for wrapping up. Summarise all the argument and explain the topic in a better way. DO NOT START A NEW ARGUMENT IN THE CONCLUSION. Ask yourself, have I answered the questions I mentioned I was going to answer?

\#\#\#\# Bibliography

\- Do not use bullet points\
- No numbered lines\
- Use consistent formatting

\#\# \*\*Proofreading\*\*

\#\#\#\# General Tips

After finishing the drafting it's time to check for correct use of grammar and spelling. Make sure you've used, Double Spacing, Large Fonts and Clearly Indicated Paragraphs. Also, make use of previous feedbacks.

\#\#\#\# Stylistics

Emulate simple conversation in the academic language. Clarity of language helps in understanding complex topics.

\#\#\#\# Language

Using short sentences and short paragraphs helps, use simple wordings but also make use of technical terms where needed.\
\*\*Paraphrases:\*\* use to understand you\'ve understood the author (with citation attached)\
\*\*Quotation:\*\* use strong and precise wordings of the author to enhance your writing. (with citation attached)

\#\#\#\# Content

Philosophical Content - Why and how should we argue?\
We argue to persuade the author to accept a better view, So give reasons to accept the view, make sure you present good reasons that are worth considering and use the Strongest objection/view first. Avoid missing any points that the author makes. Also, try to do something original!! And research good reasons for those views!

\#\#\#\# Flow

To keep the flow natural use short sentences and concise wording and sentences. Signposting helps as well.

\#\#\#\# Referencing

Use should use references to support your ideas and let the readers know the source of your information in the paper. It is essential that you acknowledge the intellectual tradition and your debt to it.\
\*\*The Bibliography\*\* section allows you to summarise and organize all the sources you\'ve quoted or paraphrased.

\#\# \*\*Submission\*\*

Remember to use coversheets and proper formatting according to the submission requirement

\#\#\#\# Words of Warning

1\. Do not exceed the word count\
2. Do not be late in submission\
3. Do not plagiarise\
4. Read module guide on how to submit\
5. Harvard referencing and properly presented bibliography

\#\#\#\# Plagiarism

Beware of plagiarising, it is a serious academic offense. You could be kicked from the university, even for unintentional plagiarising or sloppy referencing. One paper cannot be submitted in two places, even by the same author. So, if in doubt put a reference every-time you quote and make sure to use proper formatting required for submission.

\> "\
\> To write a paper you need to read, think and write.\
\> Start early to think of a strategic plan. Make time for multiple drafts and take a stand to prove what you're arguing. Also, when you write, write clearly and concisely with proper references.
