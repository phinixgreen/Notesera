C-2 Mind in a Physical World

Kim argues that the explanation of mental causation faces many problems.

The Problem of Extrinsic Mental Properties

Syntax and semantic manipulation of representational content which is also the content of intentionality.

The Problem of Causal Exclusion

According to Mind-body supervenience, mental properties supervene on physical properties.

Physical system is causally closed.

Mental or functional is Supervenient on Physical system.

Therefore, The mental must be an epiphenomenon of the physical.

If, mind as functional mechanism is not physical, then it is causally excluded.

This leads functional dualism.
