Deontology or Duty Ethics says do what's your duty. Don't think of the consequence. If you think of consequences, you'd become a consequentialist.\
Immanuel Kant was a deontologist. His approach is called Kantianism.\
Features of this theory?\
\* This is not maximizing theory. You do not try to apply Kantianism everywhere.\
\* It is impartial if the duty requires you to be impartial.\
\* But if the duty requires you to take your relationships into consideration, you ought to do it.\
\* BUT! Respect the duty, not the relationship. Love your duty, not your relationship.\
\[ Utilitarian intruder alert! \]\
Hmm\... We say to achieve a good thing, it is okay to do bad stuff.

\[ Kantian responder \]\
Halt! We say if an act is good, it is good. You don't need to do bad stuff to make it happen.\
Kant will say- \"there are two types of oughts"\
1. Categorical Oughts: The things everyone should do\
2. Hypothetical Oughts: The things (we think) we should do\
How do you measure what we oughtto do?\
: The answer is Universalizability. What is good is universally good. Ain't no scope for doubt about that.

\#\#\#\# Categorical Imperatives

This is the core principle of Kantianism. Remember kids. Utilitarians measure utility to decide what's good and what's bad. Kantians look to Categorical Imperatives.\
Always act the way you'd like to see everyone doing it, and you'd still be happy about it. Yep. That's Categorical Imperative. Something is good if everyone doing it would seem good to you.\
Here's an imaginary discussion with Mr. Kant.\
Me: I need money. I need to borrow money from him.\
I can borrow money from him if I promise I will give it back to him.\
But I know if I borrow, I won't be able to give it back to him.\
Should I borrow from him through a fake promise?

Kant: Imagine everyone else doing the way you are willing to do. Everyone would be a defaulter. Would that be good?\
Me: Damn you Mr. Kant! I can't do that. Okay. I'll stick to not borrowing.\
\#\#\#\# Understanding what's important for Kantianism

\< Your Moral Rationality is more important than your Feelings! \>\
There's no excuse for moral failures. Something wrong is always and in any condition wrong!\
Kantianism is all about Moral Absoluteness\
\#\#\#\# Second Formulation: \"Do not use a human being as means to an end\"

Simply put, this means that do not do bad to someone to achieve something good, because doing that undermines the whole principle of moral rightness.\
\~Kantianism Summarized\~\
\* Universalizable\
\* moral right and wrong is determined by categorical imperative\
\* moral agents are rational\
\* human beings are not means to an end\
\* respect persons (Widdows 2012)\
Kantianism is not over-demanding about maximization, even though it is strict about moral absolutes in case of moral decisions.\
\#\#\#\# Kantianism and FGC

If FGC is universalizable it is morally right. If not, it's not.\
Is FGC morally right?\
Argument against: \"The practice leads to pain and suffering for all. Hence it is not permissible."\
Argument for: "The practice can be done by a medical performer without pain and sufferings. Hence it is permissible and universalizable\"

Does FGC use women as means to an end?\
Argument for: "Yes. The practice uses women as means to achieve patriarchal ends. Hence it FGC is not morally right.\"

\"is it acceptable to steal to prevent starvation? Alternatively, is it acceptable to indulge and have a luxurious Christmas dinner while others are starving?" (Widdows 2012)\
Kantianism would treat all cases similarly and on the basis of moral intuition, even though some things are always wrong. On the other hand, Kantianism is legalistic and mechanistic but reducing morality to rules. Kantianism can conflict with our moral experiences and there are conflicts of rules and acts as well. (Widdows 2012)\
