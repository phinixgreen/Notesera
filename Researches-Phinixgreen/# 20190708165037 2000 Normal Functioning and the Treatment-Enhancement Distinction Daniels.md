\# Treatment-Enhancement and Moral Warning Flags

\> \"there is good reason to think that many enhancements will pose serious problems not posed by treatments.\" \\(Daniels, 2000\\)

1\. Should parents be allowed to select sex of their child?

Trying to gain positional advantage through enhancement may be self defeating because social values change with demographic attributes.

\` If all is of same height, who is tall? What is tallness? \`

Suppose the in 2020 everyone wants their child to be white. A brown couple enhances their child to white skin but by the time the child has grown up, may be being tan is the new trend. In this case, the child may hold her parents liable for the decisions made on her behalf.

\#\# Thought Experiment by author

Another problem not addressed by Daniels is the social inequality and politics of enhancement.

Suppose John from Family A is in coma. Mary from family B is also in coma.

John\'s family is rich and can keep John alive for years.

Mary\'s family is not so fortunate and not being able to afford treatment, have to withdraw support.

Now if this was the case of enhancement, John is born paralyzed Mary is born paralyzed too.

But John\' family can afford the enhancement hence John is offered better chance in life, while Mary\'s family not having the money will have lesser opportunity to do better in life.

The treatment-enhancement distinction is not clear, but it is clear that existing social circumstances does not provide level playing field for offering normal functioning to the public.
