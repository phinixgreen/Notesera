#pandemic #economy #ethics #covid-19


COVID-19 has spread worldwide. Governments are closing down borders and asking citizens to stay indoors. Meanwhile hospitals are fighting with the resource scarcity and overwhelming number of patients. It has also created a state of panic worldwide. 

It is expected that sooner or later, the fight will be over. However, the impact of COVID-19 on world economy provides us yet another warning for humanity.

COVID-19 has undoubtedly created a crisis that is unprecendented at scale. Just prior to the breakout of COVID-19 as pandemic, the world have been dwindling in its ambivalent response to CLimate Change.

What is different this time, is that we can see its effect firsthand, and rarely we see such threats affecting indiscriminate of power, privilege and economic status. The invisible had of the market is shaken, as the borders get closed and flights shut.

COVID-19 is, therefore, perhaps more than an usual pandemic.

One of the visible impact of COVID-19 on economy is the Supply-Chain. In a parasitic-symbiosis, the so called west lives on the cheap labor of third world, and the poor live at the mercy of the consumers of the developed nations. From tech industries to ready-made garments and leather, the supply of the products processed from these materials, have provided wages to the laborers while providing product themselves to consumers worldwide. Between them, the buyers and suppliers only act as middlemen, and therefore profiting from both end.

It was expected that businesses that are electronic will suffer less rather than businesses that rely on physical presence and manual labor. When buyers do not need processed materials and halt the demand, the suppliers will not be able generate revenue and therefore pay the workers. The burden, then, falls on laborers who are at the bottom and far-side of the spectrum,

One such example is Bangladesh. The Ready Made Garments sector of Bangladesh have recently faced threat from both buyers' and suppliers' end due to the outbreak of COVID-19. It was initially assumed that the country would benefit from Pandemic as most of the global brands were planning to shift their export orders from China to other RMG manufacturing countries such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, Indonesia and Cambodia. [Coronaviurs pandemic signals troubles for RMG sector](https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/analysis/coronaviurs-pandemic-signals-troubles-for-rmg-sector-1584197838) As the major consumer nations close their borders, the shipment gets cancelled, leading to sudden job-loss. 

Situations like this have shown us that some people are at the bottom of a sinking pyramid while some people float above the others. The first group are the most vulnerable population, demographically, economically, politically and socially. And whatever happens, they are poised to be the first victims of this COVID-19 Wave.

It has been claimed that elderly population are mostly at risk becuase they have weaker immune system. For similar reason, Diabetic patients and people with certain blood groups are also vulnerable.

Imagine, these people as individuals without earning, wage earners, people who were previously at the end of the supply chain. What if they were also, refugees, migrants or homeless?

In cases of crisis, our reserve capacity helps us buffer the crisis impact for a while. What about these people? What do they have? According to UNHCR, "More than 70 million people globally have been forced by persecution, conflict, violence and human rights violations to flee their homes. Of those, more than 20 million are refugees, of whom 84 per cent are being hosted by low or middle-income nations which have weaker health and water and sanitation systems." [[https://www.unhcr.org/news/press/2020/3/5e677f634/un-refugee-agency-steps-covid-19-preparedness-prevention-response-measures.html][UNHCR]]. 

COVID-19 will likely wipe out majority of these people, and their death might not matter to most. Demographically capable individuals such as healthy individuals with good immune system might survive the virus. Economically, Socially and Politically privileged individuals will be able to support their security, medication and treatment on priority basis. 

Individuals who have better survival capacity, may feel safe, temporarily, assuming survivalist mindset. Some have argued that in order to manage the outbreak and prevent a catastrophopic Second Wave of Pandemic in near future, that whole of population could be exposed to the pandemic to generate immunity could in younger people. This is the so called Herd Immunity argument.

In counter, the Herd Immunity Argument it has also been argued that by doing so, the number of patients at peak of infection will explode and people may be left without proper treatment.

When I heard about Britain’s ‘herd immunity’ coronavirus plan, I thought it was satire]]

Meawhile, the humanists urge us to be considerate to everyone equally. Some argue that the distribution of health and diseases are reflection of our social organization and how we relate to one another. In order to achieve collective good, we also need individual good. People who are infected with COVID-19 and people who are vulnerable, should not be sacrificed for the greater good. Each has equal rights to live, and there should be granted equal opportunity to live.

But surely this seem an ambitious plan. There is a need to be pragmatic in times of distress, such as clinical triages, which becomes necessary in many places. If being pragmatic in case of situations like clinical traige is okay, what could go wrong with taking precautions and closing the borders for trade?

Refuting these arguments are not easy. Clinical triage is usually performed to decide treatment options between or among multiple patients who need the same treatment against low available of utility and resource support. This may include the rations, the medical resources, the emergency treatment and support for the patients. The choices could involve, cases where allocation is needed when enough masks or ventilation machines are not available or providing vaccines when there is a shortage of supply. [If Covid-19 gets bad, triage will be needed. Are we ready for that?](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/covid-19-gets-bad-are-we-prepared-for-triage/#EthicalPrinciples)

Clinical Triage is a pragmatic approach, and although the burden of decision is usually put on Doctors, the source of dillemma isn't often the ones taking the decision. 

We may as well ask why there were there not enough masks or ventilator machines available? Asking questions like these will not solve the problem but it could make us more responsible for taking corrective measures. Global healthcare world-wide had already been suffering. If the governments across the world have been responsible, these triage situations may have arised on less occassions. If being pragmatic is so necessary now, why were we not being pragmatic before the Outbreak? 

If closing the borders does saves lives of the citizens of developed nations, what sin could have committed the laborers of lesser developed countries, that they have to die without any support or sympathy? We must ask, if we truly believe whether all lives are equal, or is it weighted economic values?

Closing the borders and shipment now, will not solve damage done. The rich can work from home, but the poor cannot. The wave of economic recession will therefore hit the poorest hard. It's not the poor who travel most internationally, but the wealthy and privileged.

Let us hope, before the next wave, the governance bodies come to their senses and start acting with better transparency and cooperation.
