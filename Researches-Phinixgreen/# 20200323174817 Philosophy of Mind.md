\*\*Definition\*\*\
Philosophy of mind is a branch of \[philosophy\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) that studies the nature of the \[mind\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind). The \[mind--body problem\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body\_problem) is a paradigm issue in philosophy of mind, although other issues are addressed, such as the \[hard problem of consciousness\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard\_problem\_of\_consciousness), and the nature of particular mental states. Aspects of the mind that are studied include \[mental events\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental\_event), \[mental functions\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental\_function), \[mental properties\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental\_property), \[consciousness\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness), the ontology of the mind, the nature of thought, and the relationship of the mind to the body.

\*\*Philosophy of mind\*\*

\
Philosophers of mind talk about things like what is a mind, what is it made of, how does it lead to consciousness, and discuss problems like mind-body problems. What are mental events and states? Why does a red object seem red (Qualia) and how can we have intentions that have contents? (Intentionality). Where does the mind reside? And how does it interact with the body? How can we have intentions that refer to or have meaning of other things? How is it that we are conscious? And how can we know that we are conscious at all? Finally, how does all these make us a person? Are we our body? Or mind? Or both? These are the questions that Philosophers of Mind ask and discuss about.
