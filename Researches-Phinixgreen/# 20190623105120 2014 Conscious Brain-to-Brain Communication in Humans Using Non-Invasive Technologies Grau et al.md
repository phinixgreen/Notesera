------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   The authors envision that a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) and Computer-Brain Interface (CBI) can be used to implement a non-invasive, computer mediated brain to brain (B2B) communication between subjects which they call *hyperinteraction* (Grau et al 2014, p.1)

-   The authors established internet-mediated B2B communication that induced conscious perception of phosphene (light flashes) through neuronavigated, robotized transcranial magnetic stimulation and claimed that it provides critical evidence that conscious B2B communication technology is possible.(Grau et al 2014, p.1)

-   The authors believe that these experiments represent the first steps to bypassing traditional language-based (motor-based) interpersonal communication.(Grau et al 2014, p.5)

-   They also believe these experiments could lead to the non-invasive direct transmission of emotions and feelings and possibility of sense synthesis in humans. (Grau et al 2014, p.5)

-   Grau et al. (2014) proposes that this technology can be made to establish bi-directional dialogue between two or more brain. (Grau et al 2014, p.5)

-   The authors also anticipate that \"computers in not-so-distant future will interact directly with human brain in fluent manner, supporting both computer- and brain-to-brain communication routinely. They believe the broad social implications in such a scenario will require new ethical and legislative responses. (Grau et al 2014, p.5)
