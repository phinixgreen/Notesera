10 Tips for Doing Philosophy

\#\# \*\*Summary:\*\* Are you new to Philosophy like me? Here're some friendly tips for doing philosophy in an organized method.

The following are the tactics I try to employ when reading and writing philosophy. They had worked well for me so far while working on my papers at the Department of Philosophy at the University of Birmingham. I hope they help you too.

\*\*1. Skimming\*\*

I am not a good skimmer. But, these are things I usually do when Skimming.

1\. Read and highlight the \*headlines\*\
2. Read and highlight the \*sub-headlines\*\
3. Read the \*Introduction\*\
4. Read the \*Conclusion\*\
5. Read and highlight the \*first lines of the paragraphs\*\
6. Read and highlight the \*last lines of the paragraphs\*\
7. Highlight the \*main arguments\*\
8. Highlight the \*main conclusion\*\
9. Highlight \*important information that explains the argument\*\
10. Cross out anything that's \*irrelevant\*

This strategy works very well for well-structured papers, articles, journals, and even books!

\*\*2. Scanning\*\*

After skimming, I try scanning, to find the \*\*keywords\*\*, that might explain the arguments.

This usually helps because authors usually use these terms over and over again. So finding them out and finding out what they mean helps me understand what they've been trying to say.

\*\*3. Outlining\*\*

If you've done the previous two steps, by now, you already have some idea what you're doing. Not it's time to outline the stuff that you will actually read.

Start again with introduction and conclusion. Then the main arguments and then the supporting arguments.

Once you have them. Write a three line summary of the whole paper. Then a one-line summary of the whole paper.

Voila. You've (almost) got it.

Don't hesitate to go back and read it again and again to find the actual outline. Once you get it, it's easier. Especially for complex papers.

\*\*4. Taking Notes\*\*

Have you tried this crazy method of reading, thinking and writing simultaneously? It helps a lot. By a lot ---I mean, A LOT.

Try summarising each paragraph in one sentence. Or better in one word. That gives you a special boost when you return to it at a later time.

When taking notes on a separate device or paper, always keep track of the references. It gets handy too!

\*\*5. Annotating\*\*

Use a software or tools that make use of the color and lines. Side note, Highlight, Comment, Underline, Strikethrough, and Squiggly are the standard. I use them in the following way.

\* \*\*Side note:\*\* One word or sentence summary of the paragraph\
\* \*\*Highlight:\*\* Usually the main argument, or the main conclusion. Bright color for major points. Dimmer colors for lesser important points. Use Blue for Definition, Green for the conclusion, Yellow for Explanation, and Pink for the counter argument and Red for things that you don't understand and will need to get back to.\
\* \*\*Comment:\*\* If you have an immediate reflection that is quite big, try inputting it in the comment option. Lots of software offer this feature, so make use of it well. You can also build the counter-argument of the point in the same manner.\
\* \*\*Underline:\*\* Usually, things that are important but highlighting them will distract me. \~Definitions are a good choice for this.\~ Use Red or contrasting color.\
\* \*\*Strikethrough:\*\* Use for unnecessary artistic words. Just put the line through.\
\* \*\*Squiggly:\*\* I usually use squiggly to point out supporting arguments or information, and counter-arguments, using the color code as necessary.

\*\*6. Devices\*\*

Invest in your devices. If your education is an investment in your future, then so is the tools that you use to build that future. Do not need high tech stuff to get the job done, but it does make things easier. What I mean to say is that unless you're filthy rich, building a gaming PC instead of investing the money in an annotation and reader-friendly device might make you regret that decision at some point.

\*\*7. Softwares\*\*

Again, keep an eye out for new software, new updates of legacy software and the tips and tricks in using them.

I have multiple reading and annotating software ready in case one goes down. Of course, they are free versions, and free versions are enough I think.

You can try -

1\. \[Preview\](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/preview/welcome/mac)\
2. \[OneDrive viewer\](https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-gb/)\
3. \[Adobe Reader\](https://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/)\
4. \[Foxit Reader\](https://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf-reader/)\
5. \[Ibooks\](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/apple-books/id364709193?mt=8)

Different readers have different advantages. Match them and use them well.

I use writing software a lot. Again, invest in your writing software. If you don't like your UI of the software, it's gonna affect your ability to write.

\~Here's the workflow I use for writing-\~

1\. Use split screen to write and read simultaneously\
2. Write drafts in markdown\
3. Check drafts in rich-texts documents\
4. Publish in PDF\
5. Save the drafts in the cloud for future needs

\~I use-\~

1\. \[Ulysses\](https://ulysses.app/): For Markdown drafts\
2. Microsoft Word: For processing drafts\
3. Pages: If I'm really lazy and comfy\
4. \[OneNote\](https://products.office.com/en-us/onenote/digital-note-taking-app): For noting\
5. Apple Notes: If I'm in a real hurry\
6. \[Google Keep\](https://www.google.com/keep/): Sudden epiphany on the road\
7. Google Docs: Save drafts for sharing with others and commenting in real time

\*\*8. Cloud\*\*

I combine free or institutional cloud services for saving the resources that I am reading or creating. Keep them well organized in folders and according to categories or else, there's no point having them saved.

\~The workflow I use is typically-\~

1\. Read about the article\
2. Find the article\
3. Download the article\
4. Rename the article\
5. Save the article in the specified categorized folder\
6. Save the citation\
7. Make sure it's annotable\
8. Make sure it has been uploaded to the cloud properly

\~You can use-\~

\* iCloud\
\* OneDrive\
\* Google Drive\
\* Dropbox\
\* Box

\*\*9. Referencing\*\*

Referencing is extremely important. For scholars and academics, this is a must. Know which referencing format you're supposed to use.

\~I use the following software and workflows-\~

1\. Download the Article from Journal\
2. Download RIS Bibliography for the text\
3. Update to \[Zotero\](https://www.zotero.org/) (Zotero can be clumsy, check twice and make amendments if necessary)\
4. Export and sync with MS Word, \[Mendeley\](https://www.mendeley.com/?interaction\_required=true) and \[RefWorks ProQuest\](https://refworks.proquest.com/)

1\. I usually sync with Mendeley because it keeps the annotations easily saved\
2. RefWorks ProQuest is good if you have internet all the time and the add-on works fine with MS Word\
3. When I'm not drafting but writing an actual paper, I'd prefer writing in MS Word, so that I don't plagiarise.

I always keep sweating when I think of what would happen if I accidentally plagiarise. Remember guys, this is a serious crime, even it is unintentional. Use a software, it makes it easier, but don't trust it too much though.

\*\*10. Thinking\*\*

Thinking is the actual philosophy. There's no fixed strategy here. But I'd use \[this\](https://v3.pebblepad.co.uk/spa/\#/public/fngGHrxx5rqfRj5dfHtrM8hr6r) tool I found in Pinterest to deploy in different tactics in thinking if I were you.

Other than that, feel free to think. Anywhere and anytime. Think about the stuff. Think about the problem. See if from a different perspective. Think as a different person. Take a break. Take a nap. Go to sleep thinking about it.

\> "\
\> A good philosopher is dedicated to thinking and will form habits that enable them to think better and clearer. After all, thinking can and does make a difference in what we do in philosophy.
