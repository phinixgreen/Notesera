Normal Functioning and the Treatment-Enhancement Distinction\
(normal\_functioning\_and\_the\_treatmentenhancement\_distinction, p.1)

1\. : Treatment vs. Enhancement: Wide Use, Hard Cases, Strong Criticism\
(p.1)

\"The treatment-enhancement distinction draws a line between services or interventions meant to prevent or cure (or otherwise ameliorate) conditions that we view as diseases or disabilities and interventions that improve a condition that we view as a normal function or feature of members of our species.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.1)

1\. Insurance Coverage and "Medical Necessity"\
(p.1-3)

\"The treatment-enhancement distinction is closely related to the concept of "medical necessity" that appears in the legislation surrounding public insurance in both the United States and Canada, and in private insurance contracts.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.1)

2.1Hard Cases and the Expansion of Obligations\
(P. 3-4)

\"These cases make the distinction seem arbitrary for several reasons. First, Johnny and Billy will suffer disadvantage equally if they are not treated. There is no reason to think the difference in the underlying causes of their shortness will lead people to treat them in ways that make one happier or more advan- taged than the other. Second, although Johnny is short because of dysfunction whereas Billy is short because of his (normal) genotype, both are short through no choice or fault of their own. The shortness is in both cases the result of a biological "natural lottery." Both thus seem to suffer undeserved disadvan- tages. Third, Billy's preference for greater height, just like Johnny's, is a pref- erence that most people hold; it is not peculiar, idiosyncratic, or extravagant. Indeed, it is a response to a social prejudice, "heightism." The prejudice is what we should condemn, not the fact that they both form an "expensive taste" in reaction to it.\"

(Daniels, 2000, p.3)

\"Cases like these raise the following question: Does the concept of disease underlying the treatment-enhancement distinction force us to treat relevantly similar cases in dissimilar ways? Are we violating the old Aristotelian require- ment that justice requires treating like cases similarly? Is dissimilar treatment unfair or unjust? Any defense of the moral use to which we put the treatment- enhancement distinction in medical and insurance contexts must respond to this concern.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.4)

1\. The Micro-Structure of the Normal and Moral Arbitrariness\
(p. 4)

\"there may be something morally arbitrary about the use to which the treatment-enhancement distinction is put and perhaps even about the distinction itself.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.4)

\"The hard cases thus pose this question: What justifies us in treating the normal but "bad" or disadvantageous genes differently from genes that lead to growth hormone deficiency or to receptor insensitivity to growth hormone? If we can remedy the effect of these genes with growth hormone treatment or other treatments, including genetic tampering, we might think it quite arbitrary to maintain the treatment-enhancement distinction.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.4)

1\. Two Objections to the Treatment-Enhancement Distinction\
(p.4-5)

\"One objection is that the treatment-enhancement distinction, even assuming we can draw a persuasive line between the treatment of disease and disability and the enhancement of otherwise normal traits, does not have the moral import that is commonly attributed to it, for example, in our insurance practices.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.5)

\"The treatment-enhancement distinction, then, does not map onto the boundary between morally obligatory and nonobligatory services.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.5)

\"The second objection challenges the basis on which the treatment-enhancement distinction itself is drawn.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.5)

\"It is our norms and values that define what counts as disease, not merely biologically based characteristics of persons, and the arbitrariness in these hard cases comes from inconsistently applying our values.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.5)

\"Are there reasonable replies to these objections? Can the treatment-enhancement distinction do (at least most of) the work we commonly rely on it to do?\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.5)

1\. A Limited Defense of the Treatment-Enhancement Distinction and Its Circumscribed Use\
(p.5-8)

5.1 Treatment-Enhancement and the Obligatory-Nonobligatory Boundary\
(normal\_functioning\_and\_the\_treatmentenhancement\_distinction, p.5)

\"we should not expect that distinction to map unqualifiedly onto the moral boundary between obligatory and nonobligatory services, even if it justifiably plays an important role in medical insurance coverage decisions.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.5)

\"There are two basic reasons why the treatment-enhancement distinction does not coincide with the boundary between obligatory and nonobligatory services.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.5)

\"First, resources will be too limited to meet all of our needs for the treatment of disease or disability.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.5)

\"The second reason for limiting the role of appeal to the treatment-enhancement distinction also rules out this (unqualified) suggestion. We may---indeed we do---have certain moral or legal obligations to offer medical services that do not involve the treatment of dis- ease.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.6)

\"sometimes concerns about equality of oppor- tunity might oblige us to provide some genetic interventions even when they too were not treatments of disease.\"\
(Daniels, 2000,p.6)

\"My account, however, stops short of leveling the field further by the redistributing of otherwise normal capabil- ities, and it is the justification for this stopping point that is at issue in the hard cases we have been examining.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.7)

\"dyslexia is a cognitive disability in any society, but it is important to treat it only in literate societies. Within a society, relative to its normal range of opportunities, some diseases and disabilities are more important to treat than others, and this will affect our decisions about which treatments to offer when we cannot provide all the ones people need\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.7)

\"it is critical to keep in mind that the treatment-enhancement distinction by itself does not specify the boundary between obligatory and nonobligatory medical services. Some obligations derive from considerations beyond the primary rationale, and the primary rationale includes a respect for reasonable resource constraints.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.8)

\"On my view, the central moral impor- tance, for purposes of justice, of treating disease and disability with effective healthcare services derives from the way in which protecting normal function- ing contributes to protecting opportunity. Specifically, by keeping people close to normal functioning, healthcare protects an individual's fair share of the range of opportunities reasonable people would choose in a given society. That fair share is defined by reference to the individual's talents and skills.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.7)

\"it may still be the case that the primary rationale for claiming that we are obligated to provide people with medical service is that it meets an important need for treatment of disease or disability\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.6)

\"both physical and mental, are construed as adverse departures from or impairments of species-typical normal functional organization or "normal functioning," for short.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.6)

\"The line between disease and disability and normal functioning is thus drawn in the relatively objective and nonevaluative context provided by the biomedical sciences, broadly construed.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.7)

5.2 The Primary Rationale for Medical Obligations

5.2.1"level playing field"

\"Rawls's appeal to "fair" equality of opportunity eliminates socially induced disadvantages in the development of talents and skills that result from unfair social practices, such as racist or sexist practices, and from effects of family background, thus taking a partial step onto the level-playing field view\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.7)

5.2.2\
\"The primary rationale rests on what we shall call a "normal functioning" interpretation of the requirements of fair equality of opportunity (Rawls 1971).\
(Daniels, 2000, p.8)

1\. The Normal Function Model\
(p.8-9)

\"certain human traits---originally race and religion, later gender, age, disability, and sexual orientation---to serve as the basis for assigning people to jobs or offices. Rather, these traits are seen as "morally irrelevant," and we believe people should be judged by their capa- bilities to perform in such jobs, offices, or educational settings. But we also recognize that past social practices may have distorted the development of people's talents and skills, and that we may have to compensate people for the effects of those practices,\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.8)

\"The normal functioning interpretation of the requirements of equality of op- portunity, whether in Rawls's general account of distributive justice19,20 or in my extension of it to healthcare, assumes that there is a background inequality in the distribution of capabilities, an effect of the natural lottery. On the normal func- tioning interpretation, equal opportunity does not require assuring truly equal op- portunity, which could result only if we eliminated this inequality in distribution of capabilities\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.8)

\"A fundamental point to note is that our egalitarian concerns in general, and our concerns about equal opportunity in particular, form only part of our concerns about what justice requires.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.9)

\"A theory of justice in general, or of justice for healthcare in particular, must combine concerns about equality with con- cerns about liberty, and both of these concerns must be reconciled with con- siderations about efficiency and the allocation of resources.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.9)

"natural" distribution as a baseline, we must reconcile the pull of that concern with conflicting goals regarding liberty and efficiency.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.9)

\"Rawlsian reconciliation, even if it captures the general case, will not justify treating the natural baseline as if it were an uncrossable boundary and that modification of it in the name of equal opportunity never falls within the scope of concerns of justice.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.9)

\"The baseline that emerges over time is most likely one that is compatible with the demands of justice in a pluralist society\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.11)

\"The position I am defending, then, does not insist that the natural baseline is completely natural and that no valuations incompatible with pluralism have emerged within it.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.11)

\"Suppose it is a "social construct" after all and draws on some disguised comprehensive moral views\...that we have often sneaked valuations into our categorization of disease, so too we have evidence that we have rooted them out over time\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.11)

\"This is a partial recognition of the tendency of the sciences to be compatible with pluralism.\"\
(Daniels, 2000,p.11)

\"Despite many other sorts of comprehensive moral views, people may agree that maintaining normal functioning contributes in a reasonable and central way to protecting equality of opportunity.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.10)

\"the natural baseline has no metaphysical importance: it is not that we must pay some special respect to what is natural, e.g., by maintaining or restoring it. Rather, the natural baseline has become a focal point for convergence in our public conception of what we owe each other by way of medical assistance or healthcare protection.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.10)

1\. Is the Treatment-Enhancement Distinction a Natural Baseline?\
(p.9-11)

\"The central conceptual issue, and the focus of considerable controversy, is whether the concept of disease and disability, and the treatment-enhancement distinction that depends on it, can be drawn by reference to a "natural base- line," such as departures from species-typical normal functioning, or whether the concepts of disease and disability are fundamentally evaluative.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.10)

\"The real philosophical debate turns on whether one can characterize in the appropriate way, for purposes of theory, certain func- tions of individuals that are typical for members of that species and distinguish population variation in those functions from cases of disease and disability. It is this piece of the debate that I cannot enter into here.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.10)

1\. Positive versus Negative Genetic Engineering and the Permissible-Impermissible Boundary\
(p.11-12)

\"we may have other obligations, including those that derive from considerations of justice---such as our concern to promote equality of opportunity---that may compel us to offer some interventions that count as enhancements\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.11)

\"Suppose we had a genetic technology that allowed us to enhance immune capabilities beyond those involved in normal functioning.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.11)

\"effect---we might well be obliged to provide this enhancement as part of a medical benefit package (costs and resource constraints permitting). Suppose we had an intervention that might allow us to improve reading or math skills, perhaps through an effect on short-term memory, attention, or some other component of cognitive process- ing capabilities. Suppose further that its effect is more pronounced for those who perform in the lower half of the normal performance distribution, so that it reduces variance in reading ability by pulling up the bottom.\"\
(Daniels, 2000,p.11)

\"But providing the therapy for some would not be fair without providing it for all (or for all for whom it is reasonably effective).\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.12)

1\. Negative and Positive and the Permissible-Impermissible Boundary\
(p.12)

\"Not all treatments will be permissible and not all enhancements will be impermissible.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.12)

\"Simply because a genetic intervention counts as an effective treatment does not mean we are obliged to include it in our repertoire of permissible medical treatments\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.12)

\"Other moral constraints thus apply, and therefore being an effective treatment is not a sufficient condition for an intervention being permissible." (Daniels, 2000, p.12)

1\. Treatment-Enhancement and Moral Warning Flags\
(p.12-13)

\"Even if the treatment-enhancement distinction does not provide us with a simple criterion for deciding what genetic interventions are permissible and impermissible, there is good reason to think that many enhancements will pose serious problems not posed by treatments.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.12)

\"Knowing that something is an enhancement should thus raise a moral warning flag---this is the central implication for public policy.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.12)

\"Three types of warnings about enhancements that we do not encounter with treatments are worth noting here.\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.12)

\"First, there are public goods and other coor- dination problems that arise when all parents pursue a course intended to be "best" for their offspring\"\
(Daniels, 2000, p.12)

\"Second, pursuit of "positional advantage" through enhancement of some traits, such as height, risks being either self-defeating or unfair.\"\
(Daniels, 2000,p.13)

\`\`\`\
\"Third, we generally agree that eliminating disease and disability works to the advantage of those who end up functioning normally, but whether some enhancements constitute benefits or not will depend on the values the individuals hold, and parents' values may not always coincide with the values of their offspring\"\
(Daniels, 2000,p.13)\
