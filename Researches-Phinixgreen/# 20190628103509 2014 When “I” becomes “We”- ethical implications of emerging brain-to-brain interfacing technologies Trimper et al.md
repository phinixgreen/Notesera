## 3.3 Agency and Identity

> \"If one is defined by his or her neurophysiology, a neuro-essentialist view (Roskies, 2002; Racine et al., 2005), then how is individuality defined when a brain is synched with another's, or perhaps many others'? Might one's concept of the self yield to a new, communal sense of identity? Who owns thoughts generated in brain-to-brain interfacing?\"(p.5)

> \"Tamburrini (2009), for example, points out that by using BCI technology, users accept some degree of responsibility for actions of the machine with which s/he is integrated.\"(p.5)

-   However, it will not be clear for the receiver end to ensure that he/she is the author of the action.
