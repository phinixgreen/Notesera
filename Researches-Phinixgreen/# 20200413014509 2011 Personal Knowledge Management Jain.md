### Abstract

- this a small scale study

- explores PKM awareness

- recommends creating awareness about PKM for -

	- employee development 

	- alignment of personal and organisational goal

	- facilities and training for PKM

### Introduction

The author claims that organisations increasingly depend on knowledge workers.

According to Wright (2007), they are -

- people with high level of expertise, education and experience

- primary role is to create, distribute or apply knowledge

- The author also claims that managing knowledge is a challenge.

- According to Efimova (2006), PKM helps in productivity of an individual knowledge worker.

PKM is -

- a tool

- can equip knowledge worker with skills to manage individual knowledge

- gives competitive advantage in the job market in short and long term (Pauleen 2009 : 222)

### Background of PKM

- Drucker’s (1968) knowledge worker

- Polanyi (1958) personal knowledge management

According to Jones and Teevan (2007) PKM has multi-disciplinary roots-

- PIM (Personal Information Management) for Library and Information Management

- Personal Productivity Tools and Softwares

### Literature Review

According to Martin (2006) personal knowledge sources -

- formal / informal instructions

- memories

- stories

- personal contacts

- relationships

- books read / written

- notes

- documents

- photographs

Personal knowledge is -

- Frand & Hixon (1999) : a system designed by individuals for their own personal use 

- Volkel & Abecker (2008:95): an investigation of how knowledge workers can enhance their productivity by better encoding, accessing, and reusing their personal knowledge

- Avery et al. (2001), cited in Cheong & Tsui (2010): an overall structured process for intentionally managing information and turning it into useful knowledge 

- Academic Dictionaries & Encyclopedias (2010): focused on personal productivity improvement for knowledge workers in their working environments.

Personal knowledge has the following characteristics -

- focuses on personal knowledge

- knowledge that is important to individual (personal, work, social)

- foundation of organisational knowledge management

- important in organisational productivity

- ongoing activity

### Why do we need PKM?

KM - 

- emphasizes extracting knowledge from people

- does not emphasise personal development

- knowledge workers waste time looking for information that are already with them

- this lowers their productivity

Research on Productivity -

- Davenport (2003-2004) cited in Anklam (2009) : 40% of an employee’s time goes to waste using technologies to process information.

- LexisNexis cited in Business Wire (2008) : 62% reported that they spend much time sifting through irrelevant information, 68% wished they could spend less time organising information

- Jefferson (2006) : PKM developed in response to information overload

- Verma (2009) : response to the idea that knowledge workers increasingly need to be responsible for their own growth and learning.

#### Individual benefits of PKM

- can address the information overload problem

- individuals can recognise their own value and consequently make better decisions for self-development

- individuals better equipped to work and more productive

- employees feel motivated if given PKM tools to make life easier

- It makes people innovative and think critically

- Identifies personal knowledge and skill gaps build on capacities

- PKM manages human capital for professional excellence

#### Organisational Benefits of PKM

- Improved productivity and performance

- Continuous innovation

- effective decision making

- internal knowledge dissemination

- external information awareness

### PKM and Organisational Performance

PKM leverages 

- personal knowledge database

- organisational knowledge and productivity

### PKM Skills

- It has been that PKM should be at centre of personal aspirations and efforts (Pettenati, Cigognini, & Sorrentin 2007).

- Richardson 2001 believes, PKM is a superior technical tool than electronic information system

- Seven PKM Skills by Avery et al. (2001) cited in Cheog and Tsui (2010)

	- retrieving information

	- evaluating information

	- organising information

	- collaboration around information

	- analysing information

	- presenting information

	- securing information

- Lambe (2002): PKM Skills are -

	- identifying sources of knowledge

	- searching

	- navigating

	- analysing

	- organising

	- linking

	- mapping

	- converting between tacit and explicit knowledge

	- relationship building skills

	- communication

	- presentation

	- knowledge packaging

- Lambe (2002) argues that knowledge workers assume roles such as -

	- collector

 	- connector

	- consumer

	- critic

	- communicator

	- creator

- Academic dictionaries and Encyclopedias (2010) indicate -

	- Life long learning (through reflection): continuous improvement on how individual operates

	- Manage learning skills: manage how and when individual learns

	- Information literacy skills: what information is important and how to find it

	- Organisational skills: personal categorisation and taxonomy

	- Networking and Collaborative Skills: knowing what you contact knows, who might have additional resources

	- Research and Observation Skills: canvassing, paying attention, interviewing, observational ‘cultural anthropology’ skills

	- Communication and Visualisation Skills: perception, intuition, expression, visualisation and interpretation

	- Creative and Innovation skills: imagination, pattern recognition, appreciation, innovation, inference, understanding complex systems; and

	- Collaboration skills: coordination, synchronisation, experimentation, corporation, design

	- Information Management skills

	- Latest information and Communication Technology Skills

### PKM Adoption Stages (Cheong & Tsui, 2010)

1. Knowledge Stage: individual exposed to PKM, knows little but not been inspired to find more information about PKM

2. Persuasion Stage: individual in interested in PKM and actively seeks information about it

3. Decision Stage: when the individual takes the concept of PKM and makes a decision to adopt or reject it.

4. Implementation Stage: Individual uses PKM and may explore it further

5. Confirmation Stage: the individual continues to use it and use PKM to fullest potential.

#### Personal Knowledge Management Implementation

- Knowledge Stage: PKM Awareness through - 

	-  research

	- seminars

	- training 

	- marketing PKM importance

- Organization responsibilities through -

	- putting PKM at the heart of employee development program

	- accountability to employee’s needs

	- provide adequate facilities

	- regular training in PKM

	- modern ICT
