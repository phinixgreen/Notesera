\# The Practice of Fiction

\#\# Writing Literary Fiction

\#\#\# Flashfiction\
\* between 250 - 1,000 words\
\* Nanofictions are the shortest and suitable for internet publishing\
\* must be written and redrafted in one sitting

\#\#\# Short Story\
\* Marketplace for short story is difficult\
\* Between 7,500 - 20,000 Words\
\* Short stories take place over a short period, endings are open and abrupt

\#\#\# Novella\
\* A novella is a short novel, commonly 50-100 pages long\
\* Novellas may open with an event and then move backwards in time to give background material\
\* Can frequently place change of direction in the story

\#\#\# Novel\
\* The new writer should play safe with the structure of the first novel\
\* Kundera argues that Fiction should explore \` Missed Opportunities \` in the genre's history, such as the playfulness of dream and reality, novel as a vehicle for philosophical thought, the enigma of collective time and playfulness.\
\* Literary Novel includes psychological depth, subtle characterisation, attentiveness to the style\
\* Write for yourself\
\* You will write more easily using imagination backed up with research

\#\# Forms and Structure

\#\#\# Deciding your form\
\* Forms are categories of fiction - such as Short story, Novella or Novel, usually characterised by length of word-count\
\* includes how structures are employed to forms\
\* Structure of literary fiction allows to frame your decision- how you place incidents, where you position or resolve conflicts

\#\#\# Subverting the form\
\* \` Ambush the story \` so that the structure tells a different story from the one the piece is telling\
\* Anti Narrative Techniques in fiction

\#\# Dreaming a fictional continuum\
\* \` Good fiction sets off... a vivid and continuous dream in the reader's mind \` - John Gardner\
\* An integration of Body-Mind, Dreaming-Mind, Daylight-Conscious Mind

\#\#\# Plots and Scene\
\* Novel is a long haul\
\* Plot is of the lesser priority, the character should show the way\
\* Be aware of the cliches of Plot-\
\* Overcoming the monster\
\* Rags to riches\
\* The quest\
\* Voyage and Return\
\* Comedy\
\* Tragedy\
\* Rebirth\
\* Rebellion Against\
\* The One\
\* Mystery

\#\# Character is the story\
\* Dialogue express what they know, what they feel, going to do or do not\
\* Few good writer begin with a theme or social idea\
\* What counts is the character's story

\#\#\# Finding Characters\
\* First time writers start with fictionalising oneself\
\* Do not fictionalise people you work with or are professionally close\
\* Best technique is to create composite characters out of several

\#\#\# Character History\
\* Your characters will only surprise you if you know them ins and out\
\* Create a character history in the notebook\
\* Character history should include the details of their life

\#\#\# Main and Viewpoint character\
\* Your main character is the one whom your story is about, your narrative follows them place to place\
\* The viewpoint character may of may not be the main character\
\* they are the narrator\
\* can be more than one\
\* You may invent what is called an unreliable narrator

\#\#\# Believability\
\* Information and history provide you with the element of their backstory, their motivations and their needs\
\* character history does not provide an alibi but stops creating bogus moments of behaviour and speech

\#\# Storymaking\
\* Storytellers take preexisting stories and retell them\
\* Novelists are storymaker\
\* Handling \` Point of View \` is important for storymaking

\#\#\# Point of View and Narrative Voice\
\* First person 'I' has a purpose built narrator - it can be the writer, the person spinning a story, the main or another character\
\* Third person 'He/She' can be objective as camera\
\* Third person is where narrator does not know everything, only what they have observed in the first hand\
\* Narrative voice is the manner of speaking the choice of language

\#\#\# Beginning\
\* The story is not in the plot but in the telling\
\* Begin in the middle\
\* Confidence in the writerly voice is important

\#\#\# What if?\
\* Provoke a story by looking at everyday circumstances and events and then asking this question

\#\#\# Conflict and Crisis\
\* Conflict is the engine of fiction\
\* Job of a writer is to watch the character free themselves from the maze, not assist them\
\* Danger and crisis allows you to get into the character and throw reader headlong into the story

\#\#\# Setting and Time\
\* Setting is a stage for character, place is more than location, history of the character\
\* Time and weather affect the setting\
\* It should implicitly affect the character

\#\#\# Rewrites\
\* Read it out aloud\
\* Let the story to rest and revisit it later

\#\#\# The End\
\* The sound practice is to write several versions of it before settling in one
