According to Creswell (2013), Phenomenology is an approach used in qualitative researches, where the common features of a focus group\'s narrative serves as the basis for data. The nature of a phenomenon is understood through this approach. Moustakas (1994) describes two broad categories of question asked in interviews associated with the experience itself and contextual influence on the experience of phenomenon. Creswell (2013) further expands that the answers are analysed for specific phrases and themes that would come to define the phenomenon itself. Through this process, the researcher has a deeper understanding of the phenomenon.
