\# Reading and Writing Philosophy

\#\# The Writing Process

Writing may be daunting for many of us, but it can be dealt with systematic approaches. The following is workflow of how to write a paper at University Level.

\#\#\# Read, Think, Note

Reading is essential for writing. Usually doing the three together helps in philosophy.

\#\#\#\# Reading Tips

Make sure to Research in a targeted manner, skim and scan and, then read the supporting literature in-depth.

\* Read less if you want to focus\
\* Read more if you want your paper to stand out and have independence

{% hint style=\"info\" %}\
Reading too much will distract you from your topic, reading too little will not help in making strong statements\
{% endhint %}

\#\#\#\# Thinking Tips

Narrow down the question and think while you read. Define the terms and keywords will help you in thinking.

\*\*Noting Tips\*\*

\#\#\# \*\*Planning a draft\*\*

\*\*Planning Tips\*\*

It is always better to start planning early. Start the drafting with keeping resources ready at hand. Make sure you plan your structure first.

\#\#\# Writing a draft

Drafting workflow could be like this---

\* \[ \] Write more than one draft\
\* \[ \] Save a copy, print out or put in a drawer\
\* \[ \] Wait two days\
\* \[ \] Rewrite\
\* \[ \] Compare the two drafts\
\* \[ \] Decide which one to keep\
\* \[ \] Repeat if needed

{% tabs %}\
{% tab title=\"Outlining\" %}\
You can start with writing a one word summary of what you want to do. Then write a three word summary of how you will do it. Followed by elaborated arguments in sections. Then just fill in the sections with reflection, research and evidence.

{% hint style=\"info\" %}\
Use sections but try not to overuse it. Also, each Section should have a distinct subtopic. For long papers, use smaller paragraphs and larger paragraphs for short papers.\
{% endhint %}\
{% endtab %}

{% tab title=\"Introduction\" %}\
Be Concise in what you want to introduce. Then, Explain what you will argue. You could also explain what to expect. Of course the main aim is to take a stand that \\(This is the problem, and I will argue that ...\\)\
{% endtab %}

{% tab title=\"Main Body\" %}\
You should explain any basic terms besides outlining the material. Explain in brief the Argument in question, so that you can argue your argument in a methodical way

\* Use topic sentences\
\* Use signposting between parts of the body\
\* \\(I have argued that, now I will...\\)

Now you can explain if the topic argument has strong or weak points. Present an alternative if you think it\'s weak or compliment the strong points by saying why it is strong with evidences and references. Be sure to add strong objections first and provide strongest reply to the strongest objection.\
{% endtab %}

{% tab title=\"Conclusion\" %}\
The conclusion is for wrapping up. Summarise all the argument and explain the topic in a better way.

{% hint style=\"warning\" %}\
DO NOT START A NEW ARGUMENT IN THE CONCLUSION.\
{% endhint %}

Ask yourself, have I answered the questions I mentioned I was going to answer?\
{% endtab %}

{% tab title=\"Bibliography / Reference\" %}\
For Citing References follow the given academic style

\* Do not use bullet points\
\* No numbered lines\
\* Use consistent formatting\
{% endtab %}\
{% endtabs %}

\#\#\# Proofreading

\#\#\#\# General Tips

After finishing the drafting it's time to check for correct use of grammar and spelling. Make sure you've used, Double Spacing, Large Fonts and Clearly Indicated Paragraphs. Also, make use of previous feedbacks.

\#\#\#\# Stylistics

Emulate simple conversation in academic language. Clarity of language helps in understanding complex topics.

\*\*Language\*\*

Using short sentences and short paragraphs helps, use simple wordings but also make use of technical terms where needed. Paraphrases: use to understand you\'ve understood the author \\(with citation attached\\) Quotation: use strong and precise wordings of the author to enhance your writing. \\(with citation attached\\)

\#\#\#\# Content

Philosophical Content - Why and how should we we argue? We argue to persuade the author to accept a better view, So give reasons to accept the view, make sure you present good reasons that are worth considering and use the Strongest objection / view first. Avoid missing any points that the author makes. Also try to do something original!! And research good reasons for those views!

\#\#\#\# Flow

To keep the flow natural use short sentences and concise wording and sentences. Signposting helps as well.

\#\#\#\# Referencing

Use should use referencing to support your ideas and let the readers know the source of your information in the paper. It is essential that you acknowledge the intellectual tradition and your debt to it. The Bibliography section allows you to summarise and organise all the sources you\'ve quoted or paraphrased.

\#\#\# Submission

Remember to use coversheets and proper formatting according to the submission requirement

{% hint style=\"danger\" %}\
\*\*Words of Warning\*\*

Do not exceed word count or \*\*\*\*be late in submission. \*\*Do not plagiarise\*\*\
{% endhint %}

{% hint style=\"danger\" %}\
\*\*Plagiarism\*\*

Beware of plagiarising, it is a serious academic offence. You could be kicked from the university, even for unintentional plagiarising or sloppy referencing. One paper cannot be submitted in two places, even by the same author. So, if in doubt put a reference every-time you quote and make sure to use proper formatting required for submission.\
