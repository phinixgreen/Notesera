\#\# 1.3 Summing Up

Two ways of thinking about the relation between personal identity and practical consideration.\
1. \*\*Coincidence Model:\*\* The limits of person must coincide with the limits of particular practical judgement.\
2. \*\*Dependence Model:\*\* An account of personal identity must individuate a target.

\*\*Strong Independence Models:\*\*\
\*\*Christine Korsgaard\*\* argues that our unity as agents does not depend upon any kind of prior metaphysical unity.\
\*\*Eric Olson\*\* argues that the assumption that a metaphysical account of our identity must justify practical judgement is mistaken and has obscured the debate.
