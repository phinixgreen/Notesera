Classical Computational Theory of Mind

The CCTM view holds that "the mind is a computational system similar in important respects to a Turing machine, and core mental processes (e.g., reasoning, decision-making, and problem solving) are computations similar in important respects to computations executed by a Turing machine." (SEP, ?)

In other words, the Mind is a Turing Machine, in the analogy that Turing machine manipulates symbols to perform computations, and Mind manipulates sensory inputs to produce motor outputs.
