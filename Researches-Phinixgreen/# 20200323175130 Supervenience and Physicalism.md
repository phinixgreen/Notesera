According to Physicalism,\
\[Mental states\](evernote:///view/190787381/s716/718d0f4b-6a4b-49a5-8052-00ecda88d35c/718d0f4b-6a4b-49a5-8052-00ecda88d35c/) depends on Physical states

Imagine,\
John has physical properties P and mental properties M including content C\
If John is copied,\
Then\
copy of John will have\
According to physicalism - Same P and M (including C)\
According to Substance dualist - Same P but not Same M\
According to Property dualist - Same P and M

But Physicalism and Property Dualism is not same

According to Property Dualism,\
Physical properties give rise to mental properties, but not vice versa.\
According to Laws of Nature,\
Physical events are causally linked to one another by physical laws\
Then,\
It is not plausible that physical events can be causally linked to non-physical events\
Hence,\
Property dualism is not the same as physicalism
