### What is R0?

R0 means Basic Reproduction Number of an infectious disease. It implies the number of infection cases directly generated from a single case.

A few facts about R0-
- It is not a rate

A Disease with the R0 of 3 would then mean the following sequence of spreading-
Sequence A: 3 persons could be infected from 1 Person
Sequence B: 9 persons could be infected from the previous 3 persons
Sequence C: 27 persons could be infected from the previous 9 persons
and so on.

Note: This is not an exact depiction of the actual sequences, as there may be barriers or catalysts of spreading. For example, if 1 person at sequence B can be isolated, then at least 3 less person in sequence C would get infected. On the other hand, if the person is exposed to more congested area, the number of infected may increase.

It is therefore considered an average number of people infected from one other person.

### What is Clinical Triage


Clinical triage is usually performed to decide treatment options between or among multiple patients who need the same treatment against low available of utility and resource support. This may include the rations, the medical resources, the emergency treatment and support for the patients.

The choices could be like these-
- In case there aren’t enough masks or ventilation machines available, what will be an ethically defensible way to allocate them? 
- Will it be ethically acceptable to remove one patient from a ventilator so another could use it? 
- Should clinicians who are forced to make such choices be legally protected? 
- Who should get priority access to vaccines if they become available?



"It is unfair, inefficient, and potentially cruel" writes MATTHEW K. WYNIA and JOHN L. HICK "to leave clinicians to make ad hoc rationing choices during an epidemic without good guidance, support, and protection. Given that, a major purpose of crisis standards of care protocols is to support clinicians and planners across a spectrum of care, including extreme cases in which clinicians could be forced to choose who lives and who dies."

"When patients’ breathing deteriorates to the point that they need a ventilator, there is typically only a limited window during which they can be saved. And when the machine is withdrawn from patients who are fully ventilator-dependent, they will usually die within minutes. Unlike decisions regarding other forms of life-sustaining treatment, the decision about initiating or terminating mechanical ventilation is often truly a life-or-death choice." Writes Robert D. Truog, M.D., Christine Mitchell, R.N., and George Q. Daley, M.D., Ph.D. [[https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005689?fbclid=IwAR2Oo77V03i2oIpZENwHZXbiY_QIMdtLbtPK6mqWp6dJ78RnsPWRKHRgHKQ][The Toughest Triage — Allocating Ventilators in a Pandemic]]








### Labor shortage




### Disruption in revenue earning services due to supply chain crisis

"Bangladesh's RMG sector is now in threat from both buyers' and suppliers' end due to the global coronaviurs situation. Initially, it was assumed that Bangladesh will be benefited from coronaviurs as most of the global brands are planning to shift their export orders from China to other RMG manufacturing countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, Indonesia and Cambodia."  [[Coronaviurs pandemic signals troubles for RMG sector][https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/analysis/coronaviurs-pandemic-signals-troubles-for-rmg-sector-1584197838]]


### The Buyer and Supplier Relationship

The buyers need processed materials. The suppliers need revenue. The laborers need earnings. If buyers halt the demand, even temporarily, the pressure will be on laborers indirectly, since the suppliers will not be able to pay them.

Businesses that are electronic will suffer less rather than businesses that rely on physical presence and manual labor


### the worst sufferer could be the poor, children, elderly and refugees

> "More than 70 million people globally have been forced by persecution, conflict, violence and human rights violations to flee their homes. Of those, more than 20 million are refugees, of whom 84 per cent are being hosted by low or middle-income nations which have weaker health and water and sanitation systems."

### Philosophical Dillemma

Utilitarian and deontological theory in times of pandemic

Question: A brillaint doctor, and a villager are both infected by COVID-19, but there's only a single ventilator to get treated. Who should get the ventilator?

Question: In the post-COVID-19 scenario a vaccine has been invented. However, there is an economic crisis going on. The poor are in large numbers, meanwhile the rich are less in number. Resources are enough for the riches to survive, but poor are too many in numbers. Should the resources be redistributed?


### What is the Herd Immunity argument? [[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/epidemiologist-britain-herd-immunity-coronavirus-covid-19][I’m an epidemiologist. When I heard about Britain’s ‘herd immunity’ coronavirus plan, I thought it was satire]]

In order to manage the outbreak and prevent a catastrophopic Second Wave of Pandemic in near future, it has been suggested that whole of population could be exposed to the pandemic to generate immunity could in younger people.

#### What is the argument against Herd Immunity? [[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/epidemiologist-britain-herd-immunity-coronavirus-covid-19][I’m an epidemiologist. When I heard about Britain’s ‘herd immunity’ coronavirus plan, I thought it was satire]]

In counter, it has been argued that by doing so, the number of patients at peak of infection will explode leading to becoming left without proper treatment.


### Vulnerable People will be at risk [[https://www.thehastingscenter.org/covid-19-and-the-global-ethics-freefall/][COVID-19 and the Global Ethics Freefall]]

the distribution of health and disease reflects the way we organize our societies, and how we relate to each other. Living together allows us to create goods that help us pursue our life plans. And living together also exposes us to burdens, and harms. Public health ethics is not primarily or foremostly about the conflict between the interests of the few versus the greater good. It is about how we organize our society, how we relate to one another, to ensure that every individual is able to pursue a good life. From this perspective, the people who are currently infected with COVID-19, as well as older people and those with serious health conditions, are not the few whose rights need to be balanced against the greater good. Each of those individuals are equal members our society whose abilities to live good lives are at risk. If there are decisions to be made about whose lives are to be saved first, or what other socially valued goods need to be protected, justice demands that there be public deliberation, or as philosophers call it, the “publicity requirement.”


It has been argued that the distribution of health and diseases are reflection of our social organization and how we relate to one another. In order to achieve collective good, we also need individual good. People who are infected with COVID-19 and people who are vulnerable, should not be sacrificed for the greater good. Each has equal rights to live, and there should be granted equal opportunity to live.

\\ Comments: This may be highly theoratical, some might oppose this view.\\


### The Sinking Boat Problem

Imagine, A boat is sinking in a sea full of toxic hazards. The boatmen are concerned about their lives, and some are already severly ill amont them there is the captain of the boat. The first aid is low on the boat, and can only treat one person, and there are a few rafts and not for everyone. What is the right course of action?

As metaphorical as it sounds, this situation may reflect our current circumstances. Should we act strategically or humanely? Can both be combined, or is it it a 1:0 choice only?

This is also a prisonner's dilemma. When each is thinking of taking the medicine, and the raft, there is a disproportionate chance of survival. For example, if a person indeed took the raft and medication, the rest would likely die, and only one person would get away.

This may seem a smart personal solution, but may be it is not that smart. If that person does get away, and there is a second wave of this problem, this time the person will be alone to deal with it. It implies that the chances of survival would decrease half.

Imagine, we sacrifice some of us, the poor, the refugee, the vulnerable, the old to survive. If there is a second wave, some of us will be next. In this way, if the waves continue to wipe out even a fraction of the population non-linearly, we might end up extinct. 


### Collective Efforts

We can see the whole population, even with the vulnerable ones as burdens. On the flip side, we can also see them as potential answers to many of the problems to come. Trained properly, a human being is capable of achieving amazing feats. Giving up may not be the solution.



## There seems to be two lines of thinking

1. The humanist type is concerned about the overall survival, including the old, refugee, marginalized population.
2. The pragmatist which is concerned with decisions in the frontline, about making choices under pressure of overwhelming number of patients and resource scarcity.

Other major lines of thinking may be
3. Survivalist type where those who seem to have the capacity to survive has less concerns than those who are not capable at all.


### Trend of Vulnerability

Demographically vulnerable [ Old, Diabetic, Individuals with certain blood groups]
Economically Vulnerable [ Physical wage earners, people who are at the end of the supply chain, people whose service has become irrelevant in the context of COVID-19]
Socially and Politically Vulnerable [ Refugees, Migrants, Illegant Migrants, Homeless people]


### Trend of Survival Capacity

Demographically Capable [ Some have reported Young, healthy individuals with good immune system can survive the Virus]
Economically, Socially and Politically Capable [ Those who can support their security, medication and treatment on priority]


### Bottom Up Trimming of the Global Population
This name implies that there is a pyramid of global population, at the bottom of which lies the most vulnerable and the top are the most capable. The pandemics, in waves will eat away at the base, wiping out the a significant portion of the population and will continue to do so, if not resisted properly.
