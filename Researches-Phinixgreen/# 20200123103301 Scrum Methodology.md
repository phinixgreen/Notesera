\# Scrum Methodology

\#\# Introduction\
Scrum is a framework for developing and sustaining complex products.

Scrum is a process framework that has been used to manage complex product development since the early 1990s. Scrum is not a process or a technique for building products; rather, it is a\
framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques. Scrum makes clear the relative efficacy of your product management and development practices so that you can\
improve.

\#\# Definitions\
\> Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

\#\# Scrum Theory\
Scrum is based on Transparency, Inspection and Adaptation.

\#\#\# Transparency\
The process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.

\#\#\# Inspection\
Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect undesirable variances.

\#\#\# Adaptation\
If an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits, and that the resulting product will be unacceptable, the process or the material being\
processedmust be adjusted. An adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.

\` Scrum events \` are for Inspection and Adaptation.

\#\# Scrum Values\
Commitment, Courage, Focus, Openness and Respect are the values needed to implement Scrum

\#\# Scrum Team\
Team consistes of \` Product owner \` , the \` Development team \` , and a \` Scrum Master \` .

\#\#\# Product Owner\
The person who respresent the final users\' best interest. The manager who is responsible for product and team.

The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog. Product Backlog management includes:\
- Clearly expressing Product Backlog items;\
- Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions;\
- Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs;\
- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next; and,\
- Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.

\#\#\# The Development Team\
- The Development team members should be self organizing\
- The Development Team members are cross functional, with all the skills necessary to deliver the task\
- No title for the development team memebers except known as \'member\'\
- No sub-team within the development team

\#\#\#\# Size of the Development Team\
The size of the team should be optimal for completing significant work and remain small.

\#\#\# The Scrum Master\
The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted. Scrum Masters do this by ensuring that the Scrum Team adheres to Scrum theory, practices, and rules.

\#\#\#\# Scrum Master Service to Product Owner\
- Help with effective Product Backlog Management\
- Explain the product backlog to the scrum team\
- Facilitating scrum events

\#\#\#\# Scrum Master Service to Development Team\
- Coaching development team members\
- Removing impediments to team progress\
- Facilitating scrum events as needed

\#\#\# Scrum Master Service to the Organization\
- Leading and coaching the organization in adopting scrum\
- planning Scrum implementation within the organization\
- Causing change that increases the productivity of the scrum team

\#\# Scrum Events\
Scrum events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum. All events are time-boxed events so every event has a maximum duration. Once a Sprint begins, its duration is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened. The remaining events may end whenever the purpose of the event is achieved, ensuring an appropriate amount of time is spent without allowing waste in the process.

\#\#\# The Sprint\
The Sprint is where the work gets done. It is a time-boxed event.\
A new sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of previous sprint.

During the sprint\
- No changes are made that would endanger the sprint goal\
- Scope may be clarified and renegotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.

Sprints are limited to one calendar month.

\#\#\#\# Cancelling the Sprint\
- only the product owner can cancel a sprint, although he/she may be influenced by Development Team or Scrum master.\
- A sprint would be cancelled if Sprint Goal becomes obsolete

When a Sprint is cancelled, any completed and "Done" Product Backlog items are reviewed. If part of the work is potentially releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts it. All incomplete Product Backlog Items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog. The work done on them depreciates quickly and must be frequently re-estimated.

\#\# Sprint Planning\
The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.\
- Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint

Sprint Planning answers the following:\
- What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?\
- How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?

\#\#\# Topic One: What can be done this Sprint?\
Development Team works to forecast the functionality that will be developed during the Sprint. The Product Owner discusses the objective that the Sprint should achieve and the Product Backlog items that, if completed in the Sprint, would achieve the Sprint Goal. The entire Scrum Team collaborates on understanding the work of the Sprint.

Only the Development Teamcan assess what it can accomplish over the upcoming Sprint.

\#\#\# Topic Two: How will the chosen work get done?

The Development Team decides how it will build this functionality into a "Done" product Increment during the Sprint. The Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering them is called the Sprint Backlog.

Work planned for the first days of the Sprint by the Development Team is decomposed by the end of this meeting, often to units of one day or less.

If the Development Team determines it has too much or too little work, it may renegotiate the selected Product Backlog items with the Product Owner.

\#\#\# Sprint Goal\
The Sprint Goal is an objective set forthe Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog. It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment. It is created during the Sprint Planning meeting

\#\# Daily Scrum\
The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.

The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity.During the meeting, the Development Team members explain:\
- What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?\
- What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?\
- Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?

The Scrum Master teaches the Development Team to keep the Daily Scrum within the 15-minute time-box

\#\# Sprint Review\
A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed.During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate\
about what was done in the Sprint. Based on that and any changes to the Product Backlog during the Sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value.\
This is an informal meeting, not a status meeting, and the presentation of the Increment is intended to elicit feedback and foster collaboration.

This is a four-hour time-boxed meeting for one-month Sprints. The Scrum Master teaches all to keep it within the time -box

The Sprint Review includes the following elements:\
- Attendees include the Scrum Team and key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner;\
- The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been "Done" and what has not been "Done";\
- The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems itran into, and how those problems were solved;\
- The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has "Done" and answers questions about the Increment;\
- The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely completion dates based on progress to date (if needed);\
- The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning;\
- Review of how the marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed what is the most valuable thing to do next; and,\
- Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next anticipated release of the product.

\#\# Sprint Retrospective\
The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:\
- Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process,and tools;\
- Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements; and,\
- Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.

\#\# Scrum Artifacts

\#\#\# 1. Product Backlog\
Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product and is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product. The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content availability, and ordering.

\#\#\# 2. Sprint Backlog\
The Sprint Backlog isthe set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is a forecast\
by the Development Team about what functionality will be in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality into a "Done" Increment.

\#\#\#\# Monitoring Sprint Progress\
At any point in time in a Sprint, the total work remaining in the Sprint Backlog can be summed. The Development Team tracks this total work remaining at least for every Daily Scrum to project the likelihood of achieving the Sprint Goal. By tracking the remaining work throughout the Sprint, the Development Teamcan manage its progress

\#\#\#\# Increment\
The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must\
be "Done,"which means it must be in useable condition and meet the Scrum Team's definition of "Done."

\#\# Artifact Transparency\
The Scrum Master must work with the Product Owner, Development Team, and other involved parties to understand if the artifacts are completely transparent.

The Scrum Master's job is to work with the Scrum Team and the organization to increase the transparency of the artifacts. This work usually involves learning, convincing, and change. Transparency doesn't occur overnight, but is a path.

\#\# Definition of "Done"\
When a Product Backlog item or an Increment is described as "Done", everyone must understand what "Done" means.

This principle guides the Development Team in knowing how many Product Backlog items it can select during a Sprint Planning. The purpose of each Sprint is to deliver Increments of potentially releasable functionality that adhere to the Scrum Team's current definition of "Done."
