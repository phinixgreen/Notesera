The best way to get on with psychology is to forget about what\'s in the mind and look for correlations between the inputs (stimuli) and outputs (behavior) of the mind.

Methodological behaviorism is a methodological stricture. According to methodological behaviorism, psychologists should restrict themselves to seeking laws which link stimuli to behavior.

\*\*Arguments for methodological behaviorism\*\*

Methodological behaviorism was largely motivated by the mistaken idea that science should not traffic in unobservables.

The existence of innate knowledge would seriously undermine methodological behaviorism. Chomsky pointed out that, in many cases of human behavior, there is no principled way of identifying the stimulus.
