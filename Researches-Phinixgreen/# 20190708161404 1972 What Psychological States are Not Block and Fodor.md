## Summary

### \[168\]

"(i) Any account of type-identity conditions on psychological states that adheres at all closely to our everyday notion of what types of psychological states there are will presumably have to draw a distinction between dispositional states (beliefs, desires, inclinations, and so on) and occurrent states (sensations, thoughts, feelings, and so on)." (P.168)

"however, FSIT has no plausible way of capturing this distinction short of abandoning its fundamental principle that psychological states correspond one-to-one to machine table state" (P.168)

-   Type Identity accounts hold that there are difference between dispositional states (beliefs, desires, inclinations) and occurrent states (Sensations, thoughts, feelings)
-   FSIT has no plausible way of capturing this kind of difference because, Functional State Identity assumes, a machine table state is one to one correspondent of psychological state.

"one might refine FSIT to read: for occurrent states, two organisms are in type-identical psycho- logical states if and only if they are in the same machine table state; and, for each dispositional state, there is a machine table state such that an organism is in the former if and only if its machine table contains the latter." (P.168)

-According to FSIT,

-   For Occurrent states, two organisms are in type identical psychological states iff they are in same machine table state.
-   For Dispositional States, two organism have type identical psychological state iff they have the same machine table.

"Every machine table state of an organism is a state in which the organism can be at one time or other. Hence, if the distinction between the machine table state an organism is in and all the other states in its table is the same as the distinction between the occurrent state of an organism and its dispositional states, it follows that every dispositional state of the organism is a possible occurrent state of that organism."

Argument against this proposal by FSIT

-   It follow s that every dispositional states is a possible occurrent state of the organism.
-   In other words, all occurrent states could be dispositional states.

### \[169\]

"According to this argument certain dispositional states cannot correspond to machine table states since all machine table states are possible occurrent states but some dispositional psychological states are not. For such dispositions, there can be no machine table states such that the organism has the former if and only if the latter appears in its description. But it is perfectly possible that necessary and sufficient conditions for having such dispositions should be given by reference to some abstract property of the organization of machine tables." (P.169)

-   Certain dispositional states cannot correspond to machine table states, because,
-   Machine table states are possible occurrent states.
-   But some dispositional states are not Machine table states.

### \[171\]

"FSIT as claiming that the psychological states of an organism are in one-to-one correspondence with the machine table states postulated in its best description. The present argument suggests that if this claim is to be accepted, then the best description of an organism must not represent it as a single probabilistic automaton. If organisms, but not single probabilistic automata, can be in more than one state at a time, then either an organism is not a single probabilistic automaton, or the psychological states of an organism do not correspond to machine table states of single probabilistic automata. (It should be remarked that there is an algorithm which will construct a single automaton equivalent to any given set of parallel automata. It cannot be the case, however, that a set of parallel automata and the equivalent single automaton both provide best descriptions of an organism.)" (p.171)

-   FSIT claims that psychological states of an organism are type identical to machine table states in best description. Block and Fodor argues that this description must not be a single probabilisitic automata - Organisms can be in more than one state at a time
-   A single probabilisitic automata cannot be in more than one state at a time
-   Then,

Either, 1) an organism is not a single probabilisitic automata

Or 2) Psychological states of an organism do not correspond to machine table states of an automata

"the main claim of FSIT: even if organisms are in some sense sets of probabilistic automata, it may turn out that each psychological state of an organism corresponds to a machine table state of one or other of the members of the set" (p.171)

The main claim of FSIT: even if organisms are in some sense sets of probabilisitic automata, it is plausible that psychological state of an organism could corresponds to machine table state of another organism provided that they have the same sets of machine table states.

### \[172\]

"FSIT holds that two organisms are in psychological states of the same type if and only if they are in the same machine table state. But machine table states are identical if and only if they are identically related to other machine table states and to states of the input and output mechanisms. In this sense, the criterion for identity of machine table states is \"functional equivalence.\" Thus FSIT claims that type identity of psycho- logical states is also a matter of a certain kind of functional equivalence; psychological states are type identical if and only if they share those properties that must be specified to individuate a machine table state."

-   FSIT holds that two organism are in same psychological state iff they are in the same machine table state.
-   If two machine table states are identical to one another, then so should be the input and output mechanisms.
-   FSIT describes this as Functional Equivalence rather than physical equivalence.

### \[175\]

"5) The following argument seems to us to show that the psychological states of organisms cannot be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the machine table states of organisms."

"The set of states which constitute the machine table of a probabilistic automaton is, by definition, a list. But the set of mental states of at least some organisms (namely, persons) is, in point of empirical fact, productive. In particular, abstracting from theoretically irrelevant limitations imposed by memory and mortality, there are infinitely many type-distinct, nomologically possible psychological states of any given person. The simplest demonstration that this is true is that, on the assumption that there are infinitely many non-equivalent declarative sentences, one can generate definite descriptions of such states by replacing S with sentences in the schemata A:

A: \"the belief (thought, desire, hope, and so forth) that S\"

In short, while the set of machine table states of a Turing machine can, by definition, be exhaustively specified by listing them, the set of mental states of a person can at best be specified by finite axiomatization." (175-176)

Block and Fodor claims that some mental states are productive.

-   They define productivity as a person being capable of imagining "infinitely many type-distinct, nomologically possible psychological states" (176)
-   If A is a schemata

and such that A: "the belief that S"

One can produce infinitely many non-equivalent declarative senses by replacing S in A.

For example: A: He believes that S

S= {John is tall, Mary cannot see red, he is philosopher,.....}

-   the set of machine table states of Turing Machine can be specified exhaustively by listing them.
-   The mental states of a person can be specified through axiomatisations that are finite.

### \[177\]

"what the present argument seems to show is that the psychological states of an organism cannot be put into correspondence with the machine table states of an automaton. What it of course does not show is that the psychological states of an organism cannot be put into correspondence with the computational states of an automaton." (177)

-   This shows that psychological states of an organism cannot be in correspondence with the machine table states of an automaton.
-   It does not show that the psychological states of organism cannot be put into correspondence with the computational states of an automaton.

### \[178\]

"The reason there are structural parallelisms among sentences is that sentences are constructed from a fixed set of vocabulary items by the iterated application of a fixed set of rules, and the theoretical vocabulary required to analyze the ways in which sentences are structurally similar is precisely the vocabulary required to specify the domain of those rules. In particular, structurally similar sentences share either lexical items or paths in their derivations, or both. Thus one explains structural similarities between sentences in the same way that one explains their productivity: namely, by describing them as a generated set rather than a list."

-   Sentences are constructed from the application of a fixed set of vocabulary items by a fixed set of rules.
-   This is why sentences are structurally similar
-   And can be described as generated set rather than preprogrammed list of sentences

"the same considerations apply to the set of psychological states of an organism. Almost certainly, they too are, or at least include, a generated set, and their structural similarities correspond, at least in part, to similarities in their derivation; that is, with psychological states as with sentences, the fact that they are productive and the fact that they exhibit internal structure are two aspects of the same phenomenon. If this is true, then a theory which fails to capture the structural relations within and among psychological states is overwhelmingly unlikely to arrive at a description adequate for the purposes of theoretical psychology." (P.178-179)

Block and Fodor maintains that the same considerations apply to the set of psychological states of organisms.

-   They too are generated sets rather than pre programmed lists. - This is because there are structural similarities in between derivation of sentences and thoughts.
-   This is evident in that they are productive and exhibit the internal structure of the same phenomenon.
-   FSIT then fails to capture the structural relations within psychological states for arriving at a fully functional description adequate for explaining psychology.

"This argument, like 5, thus leads to the conclusion that, if we wish to think of the psychology of organisms as represented by automata, then the psychological states of organisms seem to be analogous to the computational states of an automaton rather than to its machine table states."

This argument leads to the conclusion that if psychology of organisms are represented as automata, then they correspond to computational states of automaton rather than to its machine table states.
