\# A Limited Defense of the Treatment-Enhancement Distinction and Its Circumscribed Use:

\#\# Treatment-Enhancement and the Obligatory-Nonobligatory Boundary :

"There are two basic reasons why the treatment-enhancement distinction does not coincide with the boundary between obligatory and nonobligatory services."

1\. "First, resources will be too limited to meet all of our needs for the treatment of disease or disability."

So if everyone starts demanding enhancement, it will be hard to prioritize who needs it the most. Therefore, we have to make distinction between diseases treatment related intervention \\(mastectomy\\) and enhancement \\(breast-enlargement\\)

1\. "The second reason for limiting the role of appeal to the treatment-enhancement distinction also rules out this \\(unqualified\\) suggestion."

Abortion is neither a disease nor an enhancement. But it is still necessary due to life-threatening conditions. Therefore, a distinction must be made because it is obligatory on the view that it is life-threatening. But if someone views that it is unnecessary, then it is not obligatory. Therefore, for the sake of the mother, a distinction must be made.
