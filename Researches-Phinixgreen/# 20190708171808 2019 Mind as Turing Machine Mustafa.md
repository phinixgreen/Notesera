\# Mind as a Turing Machine

By claiming that the Human mind is a Turing Machine, one could imply that the human mind is a symbol manipulation system which is physically realized by the human brain. There are different views of the mind as Turing Machine, I will consider two early theories of the Mind as a Turing Machine. For them, the mind-body relationship is actually a relationship of logical computational system \\(Symbol Manipulation Software\\) and Physical Implementors \\(Hardware\\).
