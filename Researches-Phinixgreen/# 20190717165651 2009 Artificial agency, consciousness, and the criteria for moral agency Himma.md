\#\# The Concept of Agency

\> "The idea of agency is conceptually associated with the idea of being capable of doing something that counts as an act or action. " (p.3)

\> "It might not be possible for an agent to avoid doings that count as actions." (p.3)

\> "volitions -- unlike desires by themselves -- are the mental states that cause actions." (p.4)

\> "Agency is therefore an atomic concept and hence is a more basic notion than the compound concepts of free agency, rational agency, or rational free agency." (p.4)

\> "Only beings capable of intentional states (i.e., mental states that are about something else, like a desire for X), then, are agents."(p.5)
