Chapter Extract 1

"the brain-state theorist has to hope for the eventual development of neurophysiological laws that are species-independent, which seems much less reasonable than the hope that psychological laws (of a sufficiently general kind) may be speciesindependent, or, still weaker, that a species-independent form can be found in which psychological laws can be written." (Putnam, 1975, p437)

Summary / Paraphrase 1

Chapter Extract 2

"we identify organisms as in pain, or hungry, or angry, or in heat, etc., on the basis of their behavior. But it is a truism that similarities in the behavior of two systems are at least a reason to suspect similarities in the functional organization of the two\
systems, and a much weaker reason to suspect similarities in the actual physical details. Moreover, we expect the various psychological states - at least the basic ones, such as hunger, thirst, aggression, etc. - to have more or less similar \'transition probabilities\' (within wide and ill defined limits, to be sure) with each other and with behavior in the case of different species, because this is an artifact of the way in which we identify these states. Thus, we would not count an animal as thirsty if its \'unsatiated\' behavior did not seem to be directed toward drinking and was not followed by \'satiation for liquid\'.Thus any animal that we count as capable of these various states will at least seem to have a certain rough kind of functional organization.\"(Putnam, 1975, p.437)
