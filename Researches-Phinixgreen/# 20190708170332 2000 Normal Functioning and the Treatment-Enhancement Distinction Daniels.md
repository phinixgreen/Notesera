description: Daniels provides some objections to Treatment-Enhancement Distinction\
\-\--

\# Objections to Treatment-Enhancement Distinction:

\> "Some non disease conditions seem to oblige us to provide assistance to people for the very kinds of reasons that some disease or disabilities do. The treatment-enhancement distinction, then, does not map onto the boundary between morally obligatory and nonobligatory services." \\(Daniels, 2000, p.10\\)

\` The treatment-enhancement distinction makes policy non-inclusive thus it cannot determine what is morally obligatory or non-obligatory in medical practices. \`

\> "The second objection challenges the basis on which the treatment-enhancement distinction itself is drawn... It is our norms and values that define what counts as disease, not merely biologically based characteristics of persons, and the arbitrariness in these hard cases comes from inconsistently applying our values." \\(Daniels, 2000, p.10\\)

\` Because some medical conditions can be influenced by social construct, Our views of diseases make it hard to distinguish between what is treatment and what is enhancement. \`
