According to Clausen and Levy-\
\#\#\# 1. Free Will and Causal Efficacy of the Mind

Theories:

1\. Interactionist Dualism: Mind interacts with the physical world but cannot explain how.\
2. Epiphenomenalist: Mind does not interact with body, physical world is causally closed. Cannot explain how mind can affect physical world.\
3. Physicalism: Physicalism implies that cognitive neuroscience can explain cognition and behavior.

\#\#\# 2. Physical Mind and Nervous System

Theories:

1\. Reductionism: Mental properties are physical properties of the nervous system. In this view, in order to explain cognition and behavior, Cognitive Neuroscience has to find the physical properties of the nervous system that are identical to the mental properties. \*Identity Theory\* or \*\*Strong Reductionism\*\* does not sit well with multilevel mechanistic explanation.\
2. Multiple-Realizability: Mental properties are realized by physical properties without being identical to them. Same mental phenomenon can be realized by many physical mechanisms.\
3. Emergentism: Higher level physical properties emerge in nervous system in addition to their lower level physical properties. But if lower-level properties have done their work, the higher level properties are just epiphenomenon.

So the question, if the mind has free will, is intricately related to the question if there is a mind at all. Accepting that there is a mind, needs explaining that how the mind interacts with body, or emerges from it. However, theories indicate that if there is indeed a mind, it might only exist as a epiphenomenon, and therefore the mind does not have free will. This conclusion leads to the view that there is only brain for all that matters, the mind is not relevant / accessible to scientific inquiry.
