\#\#\# Premises

Premise composes the set of claims from which the conclusion is drawn

\#\#\# Conclusion

A conclusion is what an argument ends with, the end of an inference or a chain of inferences.

\#\#\# Deduction

If two premises are true then the conclusion must be true.

\#\#\# Induction

Inductive generalization- Past generalization \> Future generalization

\#\#\# Validity

All the premises lead to the conclusion.

\#\#\# Soundness

All the premises are true and the premises lead to the conclusion.

\#\#\# Invalidity

Premises can be true but still but may still lead to a false conclusion.

\#\#\# Consistency

if it is then it is inconsistent.
