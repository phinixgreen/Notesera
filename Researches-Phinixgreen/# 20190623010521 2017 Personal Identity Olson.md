\#\#The problems of Identity

### Who am I?

#### Personhood

> asks the question of what is it to be a person and what are the necessary conditions for being a person.

> The most common answer found in existing literature is that to be a person, one has to have certain mental properties at certain time (Baker 2000)

#### Persistance

> Asks what causes a person to persist to exist rather than cease to exist.

> John Locke said that a person is "a thinking intelligent being, that has reason and reflection, and can consider itself as itself, the same thinking thing, in different times and places" (1975: 335).

#### Evidence

> Asks what is the authenticity of a person which can include first-person memory and/or physical continuity.

#### Population

> Asks how many characters are assuming an identity of a person

### What am I?

> commonly accepted definition are-

1.  We are biological organisms ("animalism": Snowdon 1990, 2014, van Inwagen 1990, Olson 1997, 2003a).
2.  We are material things "constituted by" organisms: a person made of the same matter as a certain animal, but they are different things because what it takes for them to persist is different (Baker 2000, Johnston 2007, Shoemaker 2011).

### What matters in identity

> \"Identity itself has no practical importance. (See Shoemaker 1970: 284; Parfit 1971, 1984: 215, 1995; Martin 1998.)\"

# Notes

## Accounts of identity through time

-   The author summarises three views

1.  Psychological continuity: \"the holding of some psychological relation is necessary or sufficient (or both) for one to persist.\"

\"You are that future being that in some sense inherits its mental features---beliefs, memories, preferences, the capacity for rational thought, that sort of thing--- from you; and you are that past being whose mental features you have inherited in this way.\"

2.  Brute physical views: is the idea that identity has nothing to do with psychological facts
3.  Anticriterilism: Poorly understood

`I think that it is necessary to accept physical persistence as it provides the basis for psychological continuity which acts as the base of our first person memory and social life. In that sense physical persistence is necessary condition for our identity as a existing physical person while psychological continuity is necessary condition for our identity as a social person`

We die as an organism when physical persistence is disrupted, but this could be disputed. Our social life is disrupted when psychological continuity is disrupted, nonetheless, by virtue of physical persistence, we have some kind of psychological persistence restored, thus we could still exist as persons without social base.

Both physical persistence and psychological continuity serves evolutionary advantage, and can be argued that they are part of evolutionary process.
