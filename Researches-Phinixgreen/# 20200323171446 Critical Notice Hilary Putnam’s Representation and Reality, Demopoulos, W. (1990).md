\"According to Putnam, computationalism seeks a general theory of mentality in the sense of a theory that will describe all physically and computationally possible systems that are capable of being in some mental state. Putnam\'s principal objection to computationalism is that it fails to yield a sufficiently general account of our mental states" - (Demopoulos, 1990, p.326)\
