------------------------------------------------------------------------

> According to Rachels (1975, p.326) privacy is necessary for us to maintain different social relationships with other peoples in the society.

-   This implies that without privacy social relationships would break down. And so will collapse the social structure and legal systems.

> Rachels explains how couples behave differently \"when they are alone and the way they behave in the company of third parties. Alone, they may be affectionate, sexually intimate, have their fights and quarrels, and so on; but with others, a more \"public\" face is in order.\" (p.330)

> Considering these kind of examples, Rachels claims that \"we need to separate our associations, at least to some extent, if we are to maintain a system of different relationships with different people.\" (pp.330-331)
