\# Personal Identity

\#\# What is Personal Identity?

\> "Personal identity deals with philosophical questions that arise about ourselves by virtue of our being people \\(or, as lawyers and philosophers like to say, persons\\)" \\(Olson, 2017\\)

\#\# Problems of personal identity

\#\#\# Who am I?

\> "One's personal identity in this sense is contingent and changeable: different properties could have belonged to to the way one defines oneself as a person, and what properties these are can change over time. " \\(Olson, 2017\\)

\#\#\# Personhood

\> "What is it to be a person? What is necessary, and what suffices, for something to count as a person, as opposed to a nonperson? What have people got that nonpeople haven't got?" \\(Olson, 2017\\)

\#\#\# Persistance

\> "What does it take for a person to persist from one time to another---to continue existing rather than cease to exist?" \\(Olson, 2017\\)\
\>\
\> "Historically this question often arises out of the hope \\(or fear\\) that we might continue to exist after we die \\(as in Plato's Phaedo\\)" \\(Olson, 2017\\)

\#\#\# Evidence

\> "How do we find out who is who? What evidence bears on the question of whether the person here now is the one who was here yesterday?" \\(Olson, 2017\\)

\* First Person Memory\
\* Physical or spat-temporal continuity

\#\#\# Population

\> "If the persistence question asks which of the characters introduced at the beginning of a story have survived to become those at the end of it, we may also ask how many are on the stage at any one time. What determines how many of us there are now?" \\(Olson, 2017\\)

\* Synchronic Identity\
\* Diachronic Identity

\#\#\# What am I?

\> "" \\(Olson, 2017\\)\
\>\
\> "We are biological organisms" \\("animalism": Snowdon 1990, 2014, van Inwagen 1990, Olson 1997, 2003a\\).

\#\#\# What matter in identity?

\> "What is the practical importance of facts about our persistence? Why does it matter? What reason have you to care whether you yourself continue to exist, rather than someone else just like you existing in your place?" \\(Olson, 2017\\)

\#\#\# What are the core concepts of Personal Identity?

\> "" \\(Olson, 2017\\)

\#\#\# Quotes

\> "Locke, for instance, said that a person is "a thinking intelligent being, that has reason and reflection, and can consider itself as itself, the same thinking thing, in different times and places" \\(1975: 335\\)"\\(Olson, 2017\\)

\#\#\#\# Psychological Continuity

\> "You are that future being that in some sense inherits its mental features---beliefs, memories, preferences, the capacity for rational thought, that sort of thing---from you; and you are that past being whose mental features you have inherited in this way"\\(Olson, 2017\\)

\#\#\#\# Brute-physical Views

\> "our persistence consists in some brute physical relation. You are that past or future being that has your body, or that is the same biological organism as you are, or the like. It has nothing to do with psychological facts." \\(Olson, 2017\\)\
\>\
\> "Most versions of the brute-physical view imply that human people have the same persistence conditions as certain nonpeople, such as dogs. And it implies that our persistence conditions differ from those of immaterial people, if they are possible. It follows that there are no persistence conditions for people as such." \\(Olson, 2017\\)

\#\#\# Wider Themes

\> "for every period of time when you exist, short or long, there is a temporal part of you that exists only then"\
\>\
\> "Suppose you are a material thing, and that we know what determines your spatial boundaries. That should tell us what counts as your current temporal part or "stage"---the temporal part of you located now and at no other time. That stage is a part of a vast number of temporally extended objects \\(Hudson 2001: ch. 4\\)." \\(Olson, 2017\\)\
\>\
\> "one of the beings thinking your current thoughts is an aggregate of person-stages, each of which is psychologically continuous with each of the others and with no other stage. If this is what you are, then you persist by virtue of psychological continuity. Your current stage is also a part of a being whose temporal boundaries are determined by relations of psychological connectedness. That is, one of the beings now thinking your thoughts is an aggregate of person-stages, each of which is psychologically connected with each of the others and to no other stage." \\(Olson, 2017\\)\
\>\
\> "The temporal-parts ontology implies that each of us shares our current thoughts with countless beings that diverge from one another in the past or future. If this were true, which of these things should we be?" \\(Olson, 2017\\)
