\# Technologies of the extended mind: Defining the issues

\#\#\# Introduction

A lot of people these days are using algorithmic devices that allow blending with cognitive spaces. Reiner and Nagel recognise these devices as technologies of the extended mind \\(TEMs\\). The authors argue that these Technolgies destabilises the view that \'we are our brains\' and it is increasingly getting difficult to define what we are as a person with a \'mind\'.

\#\#\# The extended mind hypothesis

\* Clark and Chalmers \\(1998\\), who formulated the extended mind hypothesis \\(EMH\\), suggested that cognition extends beyond the bounds of the brain and skull. According to EMH the external objects that play active part in cognitive processing qualify as part of the mind. EMH thus implies that at least some physical objects outside our cranium realize our cognitive processes.\
\* Clark and Chalmers use the example of Otto and Inga. Inga navigates using the information from the neurone cells of her brain. Otto has memory deficits so he uses similar information from his diary to help him navigate.

\\\[p.109\\\]

\* Parity principle asserts that when a physical process acts as a cognitive toolkit from the world external to our heads, when such processes take place in the brain they can be called cognitive processes.

\#\#\# Technologies of the extended mind

\* The authors maintain that \"brain is a thing, while mind is a concept\" and confusing the ontological difference between the two leads to confusion about their relation.\
\* The authors define mind as the representative full set of cognitive resources that can be deployed in the service of selective, algorithmic and autonomous thinking.

\\\[p.110\\\]

\* The authors argue that this definition directly challenges the neuroessentialist perspective the brain the sole house for mind. They also insist that TEMs are also deployed in the service of thinking therefore a part of our mind. In this view, mental process and mind not only include cognitive processes but also refer to \'affective motivational and social resources\' which influence our thinking.\
\* What are TEMs? An example from the Nagel et al \\(2016\\) describes a 35 year old man John, who uses GPS to drive his Uber. At first he is not dependent on the GPS for directions. But later on, he is so much dependent on the device that it becomes an extension of his thinking process and therefore a part of his mind. This qualifies the GPS as TEM of his mind.

\\\[p.111\\\]

\* The authors argue that conceiving the mind as a blend between the brain and algorithmic devices poses a challenge to existing worldview.\
\* On one hand, it becomes too complicated to explain how an algorithmic device is an extension of one\'s mind when we already have no idea how the brain works \\(Preston et al. 2013\\).\
\* On the other hand, the very same mechanistic explanation of brain that was deployed to explain \"We are our brains\" has been destabilised by introduction of TEMs.

\#\#\# The neuroethical issues

\\\[p.112\\\]

\* The authors agree with Neil Levy \\(2007\\) that EMH has \'profound implications for our thinking about neuroethics\' specifically in the aspects of\
1. Threat to autonomy by manipulation of TEMs\
2. Threat to privacy of thought by peering into TEMs\
3. The relevance of TEMs in Cognitive Enhancement

\#\#\# Autonomy

\* The authors endorse that Autonomy has been elemental in politics and establishing the concept of human right and that it is fundamental to democracy.

\> \"A fundamental feature of the concept autonomy is that the autonomous individual should not be unduly influenced when making decisions \\(Frankfurt 1971; Dworkin 1981\\)\"

\* The authors observe that \"the picture of humans as self-sufficient rational actors who live their lives independently of others\" is different from how people actually live in the real world. The authors contend that our decisions are influenced by inputs from others, in form of books, newspapers or opinion of others and other socio-physical environment.

\\\[p.113\\\]

\* This has led to the view of Relational Autonomy which suggests that when people make decisions they often are take into account the inputs from people around them and that this happens without reluctance complicates the \'calculus for evaluating when an external influence might be considered due and undue.\'

\> \""representing these two sorts of effects with roughly accurate proportionality is, however, a formidable project \\\[since\\\] matters of degree are notoriously difficult to specify philosophically" \\(Friedman 2003\\).\"

\* Persuasiveness

\> \"Decision-making can be influenced across a spectrum ranging from minimally to highly persuasive, and can even turn into being coercive \\(Fogg 2002; Verbeek 2006, 2009\\).\"

\* The authors acknowledge that the ability to learn about user preference is essential to design algorithms for better usage, but the fact that some algorithms are extension of our mind are also extensions of some other party makes the TEMs vulnerable to manipulation.

\\\[p.115\\\]

\#\#\# Privacy of thought

\* The authors contend that TEMs may allow intrusions upon the privacy of our thoughts especially considering that online privacy is largely under threat.

\> \"The manifesto establishing the right to privacy was drafted in 1890 by Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis \\(Warren & Brandeis 1890\\).\"

\\\[p.116\\\]

\* Warren and Brandeis \\(1890\\) noted that \"recent inventions and business models call attention to the next step which must be taken for the protection of the person\"\
\* This view is supported by Legal arguments

\> \"Wittes and Chong suggest that the third-party doctrine is ill-suited to the modern situation in which devices generate data about their users \\(Wittes & Chong 2014\\).\"

\\\[p.117\\\]

\* Explained by Michael Lynch, both Descartes and Locke held that one\'s ownership of thought is defined by the fact that the have privileged first person access to these thoughts and one has reasonable control over how one communicates these thoughts to others.

\> \\\[In case of TEMs,\\\] \"if you have a private means of accessing information on your device that is not available to others, and you have the means of controlling that access, it seems as if you have demonstrated that, in your view, it is private. The problem arises, of course, when those very same devices are connected to others by virtue of the ever-present Internet.\"

\\\[p.118\\\]

\#\#\# TEMs necessitate a new framework for neuroethics

-The authors acknowledge that philosophers have long held the view that people cannot be conceived as isolated beings but beings who are \_socially embedded\_. These ideas can be found in Hegel and Marx and has been extensively studied by Klaus Holzkamp\\(1985\\). According to his views, \"social embeddedness goes beyond the direct private relations between and among individuals, reaching out to the various social institutions that surround and influence us.\" This applies for TEMs and us where we can be categorised as \_technologically embedded\_ beings.

\* The authors argue that the mind being the most intimate part of us, conceptualising TEMs allow for challenging the sense of who we are as humans beings.\
\* Neuroethicists have argued that questions such as Who am I? Am I my brain? Am I my mind? Am I my relationships? are viewed differently when a person recognises that technologies serve as the function of self \\(Haslam 2004; Rose 2005; Feinberg 2006; Glannon 2009; Burwood 2009; Noë 2009; Brand 2010; Brenninkmeijer 2010; Pardo & patterson 2010; Reiner 2011\\). The authors urge that with this perspective, we have to find a new mode of being and therefore a new mode of understanding ourselves and others.

\#\# Notes

\` Questions: To what extent another person qualifies as extensions of our mind? \`

\#\#\# Summary

The authors call for a new framework for neuroethics informed by Philosophy of Mind which reconsiders how humans are extended by the technologies they use.

Specifically they want philosophers to ask questions such as-

1\. What is at stake when studying neuroethical questions?

2\. What is the \"substrate\" we are dealing with?

The authors argue that taken into consideration the intertwinement of modern humans and their surroundings, we should and cannot any longer focus on human brain as isolated or at most integrated into a body. Rather, the body is constantly interacting with the environment \\(Varela et. al. 1991; Gallagher 2005; Fuchs 2011; Nagel 2015\\) and surroundings, significant and non-significant others and technologies. According to their framework, neuroethics is not so much concerned about an organ but with the idea of what makes us a human being.
