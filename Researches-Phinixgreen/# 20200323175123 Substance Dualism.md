\*\*Definition\*\*

Dual means two, and ism is the view that there are two types of things. Substance dualists argue that there are two different substances that make a human being.

According Substance Dualism, famously argued by Rene Descartes, the mind is made of non-physical substance, and the body is made of physical substance. But together they make us human beings.

How does non-physical substance interact with physical substance or where they are located in the physical realm is not clearly defined by substance dualist themselves.
