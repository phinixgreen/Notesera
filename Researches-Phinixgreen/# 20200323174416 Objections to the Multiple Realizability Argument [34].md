Objections to the Multiple Realizability Argument

The structure of the argument is as follows,

Let us assume that,

Two entity, A and B whose

Physical Realizers are (PR)A and (PR)B

PRs determine the Computational System(CS) of A and B

These are, by sequence, (CS)A and (CS)B

PRs are determined by the Elemental Composition (PR-EC) and Structural Complexities (PR-SC). More specifically, (PR-EC) at atomic level determines the (PR-SC) at more macro level. Together, (PR-EC) and (PR-SC) determine the nature of Physical Realisers.

Let us assume, for A and B

Elemental Compositions are (PR-EC)A and (PR-EC)B

Structural Complexities are (PR-SC)A and (PR-SC)B

The multiple realizability argument holds that-

(CS)A = (CS)B

Even though (PR)A =/= (PR)B

PR is the complex physical structure that acts as realisers for computational systems

The idea that, (PR)A =/= (PR)B

Entails that (PR-EC)A =/= (PR-EC)B

Therefore, (PR-SC)A =/= (PR-SC)B

But if the structural complexity of A and B are different,

Then it entails that (CS)A =/= (CS)B

In other words, in theory they will have different computational systems.

If this is the case, then, the multiple realizability argument does not hold.

If one reconsider the variables A and B in the following manner,

A= Silicon based entity

B= Hydrocarbon based biological entity

It follows that, it is highly unlikely that a silicon based entity will have the same mental type as hydrocarbon based biological entity.
