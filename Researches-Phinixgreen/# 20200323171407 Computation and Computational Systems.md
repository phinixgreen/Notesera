What is Computation?

Computation is the a mechanism of processing information. For a specific set of input, the mechanism provides specific sets of outputs. This mechanism is the computational system.

What is a Computational System?

A computational system computes information by taking in specific sets of inputs and providing specific sets of outputs using its logical architecture.

The architecture requires components such a set of instructions. For specific inputs, specific instruction will get activated and provide the pre-set output.

For example if the instruction for a vending machine is that

For-

3 coins as input, the output is a cola.

For coins less than 3, the output is no output.

Now, if a person inserts three coins, he/she receives a cola from the machine, and if two or one coins are inserted, the vending machine provides nothing to that person.
