Extract 1

\`\`\`\
\"In Content and Consciousness, Dennett crystallized the last doctrine in his noted distinction between the \"personal\" and \"sub-personal\" levels. Although we must ascribe normative, rational, contentful states at the personal level, we may not infer that anything inside the person (a sub-personal part) bears such content." (Kitcher, 1990, p.127)

\"people truly have such beliefs, for we get true behavioral predictions on this assumption; yet, nothing inside a person\'s head is a belief. This makes him a kind of instrumentalist.\"\
(Kitcher, 1990, p.127)\
