\#\# What is dual use in Neuroethics?

\> \"In the ethics of (bio)technology, the dual-use problem refers primarily to the cooptation of civilian technology for military aims. This expression is also used to refer to the possibility of utilizing the same technology for both beneficial (e.g., clinical) applications and harmful misuse(e.g., bioterrorism)\" (Ienca & Jotterand, 2018)

According to Ienca and Jotterand (2018), dual-use problem refers to the use of bio-tech for both civilian and military use as well as the harmful misuse and beneficial applications.

===

1\. First the Ienca et al. (2018) defines Dual-Use in Neuroethics as deriving from Dual-use in Bioethics, which is use of Neural Technology for both civilian and military and often useful and negative purposes.\
1. They cite Tennison and Moreno (2012) who have studied DARPA's initiative and categorises dual-use opportunities into three tech-\
1. BCI\
1. In BCI's case, the same technology that can benefit civilians can benefit the military goals.\
2. Neuroenhancment for warfare\
3. Neurodetector for legal and criminal purposes\
2. In this view, dual-use is an ethical dilemma that is conflict between the promotion of harmful and useful use of neurotechnology\
2. Next, the authors argue that Dual-Use of Neurotechnology can run in circularity\
1. The progressive number of uses of clinical and consumer-grade neurotech can seep into military uses and such dependencies can run in circular form \[!\]\
3. In this view, Ienca et al. (2018) describes some views on the global ban on Dual-Use Neurotechnology\
1. They mention, Scholars' stance against the military use cases of neurotech\
2. On the other hand they also identify the need of defense funded Neuroscience research for public good\
4. The authors therefore urge the need for increased monitoring of the dual-use of neurotechnology.\
1. Reason 1: Neurodevices have the capacity to alter neural correlates of mental processes\
2. Reason 2: Neuroweapons, it has been argued, disrupt the premise of responsibility under International Humanitarian Law (Noll, 2014)\[!\]\
3. Reason 3: Dual-use Neurotech are not properly identified in the Human Rights to Autonomy, Privacy and Mental or Physical Integrity\
5. The suggestions from Ienca et al (2018) are\
1. Identifying these uses in relation to Human Rights to Autonomy, Privacy, Mental or Physical Integrity\
2. Developing Codes of ethical conduct to maximise benefits of military neuroscience and the harms of civilian use cases. In particular -\
1. Clinical Trials should be preceded by safety and effectiveness\
2. Prioritise treatment resistant conditions\
3. Reduce unintended collateral damage to brain functions\
4. Follow IRB approval and informed consent\
6. The authors propose -\
1. A neurosecurity framework should raise awareness among neuroscientists.\
1. Military Funding for neuroscientist who may not consider how their work contributes to warfare\
2. Public engagement strategies should be supported and encouraged

\#\# Thoughts

Can Civilian Entrepreneurship lead to indirect dual-use dilemma?

Let's say, civilian projects are encouraged

Let's say, civilian entrepreneurship in neurotech is also encouraged.

Let's say, this results in public-platform booming into a megacorporation.

Now, the CEO of this corp owns the neural information of many civilians, as well as the employees with access.\
Anyone except the user should not have the password of his her account. But google, facebook store these passwords and for valid reason. But they could be misused, sold without notice.

And if by the time there is a backlash, it might be too late to reconcile the pivotal powers.

\* Restricted to clinical uses only and not for public-entertainment or millitary use-cases.
