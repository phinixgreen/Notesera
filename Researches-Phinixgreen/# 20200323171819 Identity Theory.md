The Identity theory argues that the mind is the brain. According to J.J.C Smart, the mind is nothing beyond physical events. So what we call mind is actually physical phenomena happening inside the brain.

This is a kind of physicalism in the sense that it denies that mind exists as non-physical substance. It is also called type physicalism because it substitutes mental types with physical types.

Substance dualists would have to draw complex relations between non-physical and physical phenomenon. Identity theory asserts that through simplicity and parsimony arguments, identity theory is better than other theories of mind. Thus we ought to accept that the mental types are actually physical types.

One weakness of type physicalism is that it fails to explain multiple realisability. The phenomenon that same type of pain can exist as different tokens of pain in different biological organisms.
