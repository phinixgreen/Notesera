Scientific View and the non-scientific view Are these compatible?

Physicalism as the source of mind-body problem.

-   How to explain consciousness in a physical world?
-   If mind is not physical how can it have effects on physical world?
-   If mind is physical, how to understand consciousness?

`Question: Can an electron see an electron? What is it like to be an electron and see other electrons? Does electron has subjective point of view towards other electrons?`
