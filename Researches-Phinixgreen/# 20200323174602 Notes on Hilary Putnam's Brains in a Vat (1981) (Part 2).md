Notes on Hilary Putnam\'s \"Brains in a Vat\" (1981) (Part 2)

\~\*\*Summary:\*\*\~

Putnam combines Brains in the Vat with Turing machine thought experiment and argues that Brains in a vat cannot refer to themselves as brains in a vat. That would be a self-refuting argument. He also argues how mental objects themselves do not refer to anything in themselves. It is only concepts or common social references to phenomenal or physical objects that constitute the meanings of such objects.

\~\*\*Brains in vat (again)\*\*\~

\~Comparing brains in a vat to the\~ \~turing\~ \~machines\~

\*\*Facts\*\*

\* Brains in a vat do not have sense organs, they think they have sense organs, and they are fed senses through machine implants\
\* Putnam asks then, if they had never seen trees through their eyes, (because they don't have eyes) has they ever really seen any tree or can they ever refer to a real tree?

To put it another way--- Can the brains in vat ever refer to an external object?

\* The obvious question is then how do they know about external objects? Putnam proposes hypothetically that intelligent machines have no intelligent creator at all. In that case, all sentient beings are inside the vat.

\~\*\*Thoughts:\*\*\~

How do the machines know what a tree looks like then? Since everything is really inside the machine, there seems to be no external trees. The machines are just feeding the brains in the vats senses of trees. But that seems contradictory, becuase senses must come from some external objects. Then trees have to be external objects.

\*"In short, the brains in a vat are not thinking about real trees when they think \'there is a tree in front of me\' because there is nothing by virtue of which their thought \'tree\' represents actual trees." (Putnam, 1981)\*

\* To paraphrase, Putnam is saying there's no causal link between the representation of trees in the brains in a vat and actual trees.

\> "\
\> "If these brains think about, refer to, represent trees (real trees, outside the vat), then it must be because of the way the \'program\' connects the system of language to non-verbal input and outputs. There are indeed such non-verbal inputs and outputs in the Brain-in-a-Vat world (those efferent and afferent nerve endings again!), but we also saw that the \'sense-data\' produced by the automatic machinery do not represent trees (or anything external) even when they resemble our tree-images exactly."

\> (Putnam, 1981)

But Putnam is saying that even if there were a causal link between the representation in the brains in the vat and the actual trees, as these would be nonverbal input and sense data translated by machines describing the trees.

Thoughts:

Sense data and translation of sense data is not the same. Feeding sense data would be machines \'Seeing\' trees and transferring these data to brains. On the other hand, translating sense data would be \'Seeing\' trees and then \'Describing\' what a tree looks like.

\*"How can the fact that, in the case of the brains in a vat, the language is connected by the program with sensory inputs which do not intrinsically or extrinsically represent trees (or anything external) possibly bring it about that the whole system of representations, the language-in-use, does refer to or represent trees or anything external?" (Putnam, 1981)\*

\* Putnam is arguing then that \*\*since simple languages cannot represent an actual object, it is not possible for the system to create a whole system of representation based on that same linguistic principle\*\*\
\* The mechanism imagined by Putnam is such

Sense-data, motor-signal (Actual Tree)\> \|Language entry rules\| \> Verbally conceptually mediated thought \> \|Language exit rules\| \> Sense-data, motor-signal (Image of Tree) in Brains in Vats

\* Putnam says that through this mechanism the Brains in Vats will not be able to refer to actual Trees as external things.

\~Thoughts\~

Sense data need not be translated to sense-data through language entry-exit rules. They can be done electro-magnetically and it still does a good job in help seeing. For example Some prosthetics allow patients with visual disabilities to see colors and objects. These mechanisms do not need to use language entry-exit rules as the Turing machine, but still does a very good job.

\~\*\*The\*\*\~ \*\*\~premisses\~\*\* \~\*\*of the argument\*\*\~

\~The brains in a vat cannot think or say that they are brains in a vat\~

\* When the brain is in a vat,

\* the brain's thought about tree does not represent a tree. It is an image of a tree without representation of an actual tree.\
\* From a subjective point of view, the brain is right about thinking it is seeing a tree.\
\* But from an objective point of view, their subjective experience does not actually represent an actual tree.

\* In other words, the brains are just a thinking extension of the machines themselves.\
\* Now if brains are in a possible world and we are the brains in that possible world

\* and we say \*"We are brains in a vat"\*

\* it implies that we are referring to ourselves as images without no reference to actual us

To simplify,

1\. Brains in vat cannot refer to real objects.\
2. If we are brains in vats, then we cannot refer to ourselves as real objects.\
3. If we can refer to ourselves as brains in vats then it implies that we are not real objects.\
4. But if we are not real how can we make the statement that "We are not real"\
5. This is self-contradiction. Therefore, it must be that the statement that we are brains in vats is false.

\*\*Conclusion:\*\* We are not brains in the vats.

\*"The supposition that such a possibility makes sense arises from a combination of two errors:\*

1\. \*Taking physical possibility too seriously; and\*\
2. \*unconsciously operating with a magical theory of reference, a theory on which certain mental representations necessarily refer to certain external things and kinds of things." (Putnam, 1981)\*

\~\*\*Explaining 1. Taking physical possibility too seriously\*\*\~

Putnam is basically saying that physical possibility does not mean it is an existent physical reality. It only means that the nature of reality could allow for the situation in concern to be possible.

\~\*\*Objection 1 to Explanation 1\*\*\~

This objection implies that Putnam uses conceptual possibility as a physical possibility.

\*\*\~Response 1 to Objection 1\~\*\*

Putnam responds that his argument can be described as conceptual one but to say that Putnam's method is a search for conceptual truth sounds like an inquiry about \*the meaning of words\* (Putnam, 1981)

Putnam adds that he is taking the possibilities through considering preconditions about thinking and representing and referring. He backs this up by saying these preconditions were investigated not through the meaning of words, but through senses which he calls \*reasoning a priori\*

He defends by saying he combines empirical reasoning and priories to establish his arguments.

\*\*Comment:\*\* The question is answered. But still, what about the priories themselves? Should we take priories about our ability to refer and think as given? Doesn\'t that lead to a circular problem of verifying our existence through the senses?

\*\*\~Explaining 2. Magical theories of reference\~\*\*

\*\*Premise 1.\*\* The magical theories of reference are wrong for both mental and physical representation

\*\*Premise 2.\*\* One cannot refer to certain kinds of things (e.g. a tree) if there is no causal interaction (link) between that thing (actual Tree) and the reference object (the word: "Tree")

\~\*\*The reasons for denying necessary connections between representations and their referents\*\*\~

Putnam mentions Brentano for ascribing "intentional" power to the mind. Intentionality allows one to refer to other objects, which physical things cannot.

Putnam also adds that his kind did not claim that "we can think about external things or properties without using representations at all." (Putnam, 1981)

\* Putnam argues that images do not necessarily refer to anything in itself.\
\* If mental representations are images then they do not refer to anything\
\* But if mental representations are not images then they are concepts that can refer to something\
\* if follows that concepts and images are not the same things

\~\*\*Explaining Concept\*\*\~

Putnam says concepts are not intrinsically, mental representations that refers to objects.

Concepts are signs used in a certain way. Signs do not refer intrinsically as well.

But

\* Possessing a concept is not the same as possessing an image

\*"For the image, if not accompanied by the ability to act in a certain way, is just a picture" (Putnam, 1981)\*

Image without intentional representation is just a picture.

Having lots of image without the ability to link it to the appropriate situation will be futile for a person.

\> "\
\> "If "meanings just aren\'t in the head" (Putnam 1981, p.19) then meanings are social. So, when he says "possessing a concept is not a matter of possessing images"(Putnam 1981, p.19) he is implying that possessing images cannot necessarily mean it represents or refers to an object. Whereas, possessing concepts means that one has the ability to refer to objects that others are able to refer to as well and that gives us the ability to attribute meaning to an object socially. Thus "concepts are (at least in part) abilities" (Putnam 1981, p.21)"

\> (Taken from Philostackexchange by mmmonowar on Oct 27)

A concept is a reference combined with phenomenal experience "to produce the right phenomena in the right circumstances."(Putnam, 1981)

\*"for what the phenomenologists fail to see is that what they are describing is the inner expression of thought, but that the understanding of that expression - one\'s understanding of one\'s own thoughts - is not an occurrence but an ability" (Putnam, 1981)\*

Understanding of the inner expression of thought = an Conceptual Ability (intentionality)

\~\*\*Putnam\'s Argument\*\*\~

"(a) no set of mental events - images or more \'abstract\' mental happenings and qualities --- constitutes understanding; and

\(b\) no set of mental events is necessary for understanding. In particular, concepts cannot be identical with mental objects of any kind\" \*(Putnam, 1981)\*

\~Thoughts\~

A word without understanding what it refers to is just word that has no meaning to the speaker. Similarly, mental objects without understanding what the thought about are just a mental event (phenomenal occurrence) that has no meaning to the thinker. Conception the other hand is the ability to find causal link/references to external objects/referents through a social cluster of understanding of phenomenal occurrences.

Mental objects are what \*\"we can introspectively detect --- words, images, feelings, etc" (Putnam, 1981)\*

\*"'concepts\', which do have a necessary connection with their referents, and which only trained phenomenologists can detect, commit a logical blunder; for concepts are (at least in part) abilities and not occurrences." (Putnam, 1981)\*

\~\*\*Conclusion:\*\*\~

\*\"The doctrine that there are mental presentations which necessarily refer to external things is not only bad natural science; it is also bad phenomenology and conceptual confusion.\" (Putnam, 1981)\*

\~\*\*Thoughts\*\*\~

Is Putnam saying, Mental representations / mental objects do not intrinsically refer to external things? Rather, it\'s the common references attributed to phenomenal and physical objects that constitute the meaning of that particular object? A collective hallucination?
