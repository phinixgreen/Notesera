\#\# David Marr's Levels of Analysis

According to David Marr, an information processing system can be described at three different levels-

1\. Computational Level\
2. Algorithmic Level\
3. Hardware Implementation Level

Imagine a switch in the following state:

\_/ \_\\ \_/ \_\\\
1 0 1 0

Here event can be analysed in three levels\
1. In the level of computation

Here the switches represent 1 and 0, thus different states representing the computation leading to 1010 is one level

1\. In the level of algorithm

Here the process of switch turning on and off is an algorithmic process. It is taking input each time and as an output changing its state. This algorithimic process itself can be thought of another level.

1\. In the level of Hardware Implementation\
Here the switch itself is the hardware, without which there would be no algorithm or computation. It is another level of analysis.
