1. The classical computational theory of mind

\`Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943) first suggested that something resembling the Turing machine might provide a good model for the mind. In the 1960s, Turing computation became central to the emerging interdisciplinary initiative cognitive science, which studies the mind by drawing upon psychology, computer science (especially AI), linguistics, philosophy, economics (especially game theory and behavioral economics), anthropology, and neuroscience. The label classical computational theory of mind (which we will abbreviate as CCTM) is now fairly standard. According to CCTM, the mind is a computational system similar in important respects to a Turing machine, and core mental processes (e.g., reasoning, decision-making, and problem solving) are computations similar in important respects to computations executed by a Turing machine. These formulations are imprecise. CCTM is best seen as a family of views, rather than a single well-defined view.\[1\]\`

\#\#\# Origin

\> McCullouch and Pitts (1943) suggested CCTM applies to mental processes such as reasoning, decision-making and problem solving. SEP author suggests that these formulations are imprecise.

\`It is common to describe CCTM as embodying "the computer metaphor". This description is doubly misleading.\`

\`First, CCTM is better formulated by describing the mind as a "computing system" or a "computational system" rather than a "computer". As David Chalmers (2011) notes, describing a system as a "computer" strongly suggests that the system is programmable. As Chalmers also notes, one need not claim that the mind is programmable simply because one regards it as a Turing-style computational system. (Most Turing machines are not programmable.) Thus, the phrase "computer metaphor" strongly suggests theoretical commitments that are inessential to CCTM. The point here is not just terminological. Critics of CCTM often object that the mind is not a programmable general purpose computer (Churchland, Koch, and Sejnowski 1990). Since classical computationalists need not claim (and usually do not claim) that the mind is a programmable general purpose computer, the objection is misdirected.\`

\#\#\# Common Objections

\> Chalmers (2011) suggested that the mind as a computer metaphor implies that mind is programmable. Critics of CCTM object to the notion that mind is not a programmable general purpose computer (Churchland, Koch, and Sejnowski 1990) but CCTM does not claim so, so the objection is misdirected.

\`Second, CCTM is not intended metaphorically. CCTM does not simply hold that the mind is like a computing system. CCTM holds that the mind literally is a computing system. Of course, the most familiar artificial computing systems are made from silicon chips or similar materials, whereas the human body is made from flesh and blood. But CCTM holds that this difference disguises a more fundamental similarity, which we can capture through a Turing-style computational model. In offering such a model, we prescind from physical details. We attain an abstract computational description that could be physically implemented in diverse ways (e.g., through silicon chips, or neurons, or pulleys and levers). CCTM holds that a suitable abstract computational model offers a literally true description of core mental processes.\`

\#\#\# Concept

\> CCTM holds that mind is a computational system. The brain is one of the many ways a computational system can be physically implemented.

\`It is common to summarize CCTM through the slogan "the mind is a Turing machine". This slogan is also somewhat misleading, because no one regards Turing's precise formalism as a plausible model of mental activity. The formalism seems too restrictive in several ways:\`

\`Turing machines execute pure symbolic computation. The inputs and outputs are symbols inscribed in memory locations. In contrast, the mind receives sensory input (e.g., retinal stimulations) and produces motor output (e.g., muscle activations). A complete theory must describe how mental computation interfaces with sensory inputs and motor outputs.\`

\#\#\#\# What is CCTM

\> Mind is a Turing Machine as in Turing machine manipulates symbols to perform computations, and Mind manipulates sensory inputs to produce motor outputs.

\`A Turing machine has infinite discrete memory capacity. Ordinary biological systems have finite memory capacity. A plausible psychological model must replace the infinite memory store with a large but finite memory store. Modern computers have random access memory: addressable memory locations that the central processor can directly access. Turing machine memory is not addressable. The central processor can access a location only by sequentially accessing intermediate locations. Computation without addressable memory is hopelessly inefficient. For that reason, C.R. Gallistel and Adam King (2009) argue that addressable memory gives a better model of the mind than non-addressable memory. A Turing machine has a central processor that operates serially, executing one instruction at a time. Other computational formalisms relax this assumption, allowing multiple processing units that operate in parallel. Classical computationalists can allow parallel computations (Fodor and Pylyshyn 1988; Gallistel and King 2009: 174). See Gandy (1980) and Sieg (2009) for general mathematical treatments that encompass both serial and parallel computation.\`

\#\#\# Differences Between Mind and Turing Machine

\> A Turing machine has infinite discrete memory cells while biological systems have finite memory capacity. Turing machine is sequential processor and mind is a parallel processor. Addressible Memory seems to be a problem for CCTM\'s model for mind as a Turing Machine.

\`Turing computation is deterministic: total computational state determines subsequent computational state. One might instead allow stochastic computations. In a stochastic model, current state does not dictate a unique next state. Rather, there is a certain probability that the machine will transition from one state to another. CCTM claims that mental activity is "Turing-style computation", allowing these and other departures from Turing's own formalism.\`

\#\#\# Determinism between Mind and Turing Machine

\> Turing computation is deterministic. CCTM might claim that mental activity is a \"Turing-style computation\" which means that there are other ways of formulating the theory.
