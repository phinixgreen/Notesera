Proposed Research Area: The human-machine merger as a viable pathway towards CEV

Volition is the will by which an agent performs an action.\
Extrapolated volition is the volition of human beings that have been extrapolated by another agent/s.

Coherent Extrapolated Volition is a strongly agreed common moral ground based on the extrapolations of our volitions.

Extrapolations can be described by spread, muddle and distance where, spread means the extent where extrapolating our volition becomes unpredictable, muddle means cases where our volitions runs in circularity, and distance means time-space after which extrapolated version will be different to relate to.

Coherence means a strong agreement between many extrapolated individual volition, unspread and unmuddled in the domain of agreement and not countered by strong disagreement.

CEV Requires preference aggregation for meeting the criteria of coherence.\
To this date, little has been discussed about the method of preference aggregation.

We propose that massive collective brain-machine merger could serve as viable pathway to collect information about preferences for aggregation. We also propose that this serves other purposes for achieving CEV, that is it leads to a hybrid singleton, platform for reflection and meta-algorithm.
