Explaining the Anomalous Monism

\~\*\*Summary:\*\*\~

Donald Davidson takes a physicalist stance, but a non-reductive one on explaining the mental phenomenon.

\*\*Type physicalism\*\* is what \*\*a Smartian Identity theorist\*\* would propose. That the mental phenomena can be reduced to physical phenomena.

\*\*\*Token physicalism\*\*\*, I think, says that there cannot be some definitive laws that establish a \*\*\*causal relationship\*\*\* between a \*\*\*mental token\*\*\* and \*\*\*physical token\*\*\*. In other words, \*mental tokens cannot be reduced to physical tokens.\* But that does not imply that mental phenomenon is not a physical phenomenon. It just says that there cannot be any definitive laws that identify the relationships between the two.

Consider this argument.

The \*\*\*causal closure\*\*\* of the physical realm. This rule takes it as a priori that everything within the physical realm is causally closed. That means that physical phenomenon causes physical phenomenon and so on and so on.

Now within this huge physical realm, we live in ecosystems, and within those ecosystems, we are human beings, physical beings. Whatever causes mental phenomenal experience or sensations must be caused by and should be able to cause other physical phenomena.

This is the causal explanation of mental causation. That mental phenomenon can cause a physical phenomenon. Not only that mental phenomenon can cause other mental phenomena because they both are a physical phenomenon. And that physical phenomenon causes mental phenomenon is first and foremostly agreed by empirical and common sense evidence.

But why can't there be any definitive relationship between mental and physical phenomenon?

Donald Davidson argues that this is because of the anomalous monism.

Unlike Smart, who focuses on sensations to provide the type identity theory, Davidson focuses on thoughts, beliefs, and emotions. And it is precisely the fact that the tokens of thoughts, beliefs, and emotions cannot be both tokenized and simplified into a law-like theory that provides explananda between physical and mental, is why Davidson proposes that it is not reducible.

Davidson argues that mental classes cannot be explained by physical sciences (Davidson, 2001, p.21).

This is Anomalism. The anomaly that there seems to be some kind of law-like relation but it cannot be explained in terms of linguistic laws themselves.

But Davidson would still argue that there is only one kind of substance (since he is a materialist), that is physical substance and that is why this theory is also Monist one.

Together this is the Anomalous Monism theory.

Davidson proposes three principles-

1\. \*\*The principle of Causal Interaction:\*\* That all physical things interact causally. The physical phenomenon causes and is caused by other physical phenomena.\
2. \*\*The principle of the Nomological Character of Causality:\*\* Causality must be ruled by some kind of law. Davidson calls this natural law. This natural law is strict and deterministic of all the cause and effects.\
3. \*\*Anomalism of the Mental:\*\* Although a mental phenomenon is a physical phenomenon, there are no strict laws that determine what causes it or how it causes other causal effects. This an anomaly.

Davidson describes the paper into three parts:

Part 1. Explain how the principle of causal interaction, the principle of nomological character of causality and the Anomalism of the mental come together

Part 2. Explain that there cannot be strict psychophysical laws

Part 3. Explain that there are some kind of identity of the mental with the physical

\#\# \~\*\*Part 1\*\*\~

Davidson aims in this part to show that these three principles are consistent with each other\
1) The principle of Causal Interaction

2\) All Causal Laws are deterministic

3\) No strict laws that determine mental events

Here he presents the version of identity theory that says there can be no strict laws connecting the mental and physical

\> "\
\> "Anomalous monism resembles materialism in its claim that all events are physical, but rejects the thesis, usually considered essential to materialism, that mental phenomena can be given purely physical explanations\"

\> (Davidson, 2001, p.10)

There is no strict law, but there is mental supervenience.

Laws are linguistic, events are physical, events can instantiate laws, but laws cannot instantiate events/mental. Thus the mental can only be described after it has happened, but it cannot be predicted.

\#\# \~\*\*Part 2\*\*\~

Davidson implies that no strict laws connects the mental and the physical. How can this be possible. Several possibilities here-

1\. Nomological monism- All laws and events are correlated in a physical world\
2. Nomological Dualism - Parallelism (Leibniz's theory), Interactionism, epiphenomenalism, anomalous dualism (Combines ontological dualism with laws or correlation)\
3. Anomalous monism is a kind of materialism- This Davidson supports

He says that, there cannot be strict Psychophysical laws because, the mental is nomologicaly irreducible, but there are correlations or law like relations. However, There are no strict psychophysical laws connecting the two.

Should we abandon the pursuit then? Davidson says we should.

There are no definitional reduction of the mental

"Lawlike statements are general statements that support counter-factual and subjunctive claims, and are supported by their instances.\" (Davidson, 2001, p.14)

Davidson concludes that Nomological irreducibility is unsolvable. If anyone tries to solve it by force, it risks the tampering of the theory itself.

\#\# \~\*\*Part 3\*\*\~

Davidson argues that there should be, at least some theory that identifies the mental with the physical. He agrees that there is a categorical difference between mental and the physical. But he also feels the need that there should be a scheme of translation

\> "\
\> "It is not plausible that mental concepts alone can provide such a framework, simply because the mental does not, by our first principle, constitute a closed system. Too much happens to affect the mental that is not itself a systematic part of the mental. But if we combine this observation with the conclusion that no psycho-physical statement is, or can be built into, a strict law, we have the Principle of the Anomalism of the Mental: there are no strict laws at all on the basis of which we can predict and explain mental phenomena.\"

\> (Davidson, 2001, p.20)

The previous statements claimed that mental events are physical, but there are not strict laws connecting them. It is plausible that every mental event is a result of some physical event, but this cannot be empirically proved through laws.

\#\# \~\*\*Conclusion\*\*\~

Main features of the theory are that there seems to be a-

1\. Causal dependence of the mental on physical\
2. Nomological independence or the irreducibility of the mental to physical in linguistic law-liken terms

"Mental events as a class cannot be explained by physical science; particular mental events can when we know particular identities. But the explanations of mental events in which we are typically interested relate them to other mental events and conditions. We explain a man\'s free actions, for example, by appeal to his desires, habits, knowledge and perceptions. Such accounts of intentional behaviour operate in a conceptual framework removed from the direct reach of physical law by describing both cause and effect, reason and action, as aspects of a portrait of a human agent. The anomalism of the mental is thus a necessary condition for viewing action as autonomous\" (Davidson, 2001, p.21)

I disagree that mental events cannot be explained by physical science. But I agree, that in abstract language, mental causation cannot be explained. It can only be explained in some direct causal interactions at larger abstractions which shows human beings as autonomous agents.

\#\# \~\*\*Interesting Aspects (Kim, 2011)\*\*\~

Is Mental causation a kind of epiphenomenalism?

Epiphenomenalism is the idea that the causation is asymmetric. That is physical can cause mental phenomenon but the mental cannot cause physical phenomena.

Mind-Body Supervenience theory would see physical objects having properties and mental events having properties. Mental properties are supervenient on physical properties. If mental properties depend on the physical, but not governed by any strict psychophysical law, still the mental phenomena are caused by physical phenomena. This chimes with epiphenomenal notion that the mind has no causal effect on the external physical world.

But if this is true, we have no free will. We are not autonomous agents.

What should Davidson say about this?

An agent is someone who can perform actions physically and motivated by rational thoughts.

The Desire-Belief-Action Principle says someone will only act if - the desire and belief of the person are sufficient for the person to carry out the act.

Davidson also says causation can be determined by identifying the effect. If this is true then, desire and belief cause the action of the agent.

So if desires and beliefs are intrinsic then we are autonomous agents.

If not we are probably not autonomous agents.

For,

1\. Physical to mental Causation- Non Autonomous, Epiphenomenal argument is strong (Desires and beliefs are caused by external events)\
2. Mental to Physical Causation- Mental Causation model by Davidson seems plausible (Desires and beliefs cause physical events making us autonomous agents)\
3. Mental to Mental Causation- Computational View seems to have strong support (Desires and beliefs leading to desires and beliefs, it seems like a processing of information)

For mental to mental causation, what causes this phenomenon? Davidson does not seem to have a direct answer to this.

Mental to Mental causations, such as, thoughts leading to thoughts have content and references, which normal causation theory cannot explain. Thus one will probably have to conclude that there are causal relations between tokens of thoughts and beliefs. But what causes it? We seem to see the effects, but the not the cause, and because of this it becomes a circular problem.

So what causes the content and reference to our thoughts, beliefs, and desires? It seems we our thoughts are embedded and referenced to our environment. Thus Davidson claims that it there are definitely law-like relations, but these laws cannot just be expressed in normal language.
