According to Kim (2011, p.151) Machine Functionalism proposes- "What it is for an organism, or system, to have a psychology---that is, what it is for an organism to have mentality---is for it to realize an appropriate Turing machine" and even "makes the stronger claim that its having a machine description of an appropriate kind is constitutive of its mentality." (Kim 2011, p.151)

In other word, Machine Functionalism claims that an organism or a system to has mentality, if it has inner psychology / intentionality and which is constituted by the Turing machine. Thus, "Mentality, or having a mind, consists in being a physical computer that realizes a Turing machine of appropriate complexity and powers. What makes us creatures with mentality, therefore, is the fact that we are Turing machines" (Kim, 2011, p.151). Therefore, in this view, it is not the physical brain that is the mind, it is the computations going on in the physical substances--- that is the mind.
