\#\# Background

\#\#\#\# Difference Between Neural Interfaces (NIs) and Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs)

NIs\
\* "Interact with brain or other parts of nervous system"\
\* "can replace, alter or enhance nervous system processes that are impaired"\
\* "record data, stimulate nervous system or do both"

BCIs\
\* "record electrical signals from neurons (nerve cells) in the brain and transmit them to an external computer for interpretation"\
\* "no universally agreed definition"\
\* "connects the brain to an external computer" typically to control electronic devices

\#\#\#\#\# BCI Technology\
BCI technology comprises of\
\* A sensing element : for detecting brain activity\
\* A computational element : To decode that activity into meaningful information\
\* A control element : "That uses this information to operate a computer-controlled device"

\*\*Example:\*\*\
BCI enabled a paralyzed patient control a tablet computer. Brain signal was detected when the patient thought about moving the cursor, were decoded and sent to a software to control the tablet as if through a mouse.

\#\#\#\#\# Types of BCI

Invasive BCIs-\
\* Electrodes are implanted in a surgical procedure\
\* Sit in an outermost layer or penetrate this layer

Non-invasive BCIs-\
\* Sensors are located outside the skull\
\* Can use-\
\* EEG - Electroencephalography\
\* MEG - Magnetoencephalography\
\* fMRI - Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging\
\* Focused ultrasound

Benefits and Problems of Different BCIs-\
\* EEG : Low-cost and portable, but weaker signals and slower transfer of information to the computer due to skull and tissue between the electrodes and the brain. Has lower spatial resolution therefore less accurate in pinpointing where a signal has generated.\
\* MEG : Magnetic fields detected are not weakened by the skull, can pinpoint with greater accuracy. However, it is expensive and not portable.\
\* Invasive BCIs: Intrusive wiring can lead to infections.

Types of Neural Interfaces by Function -\
1. \*\*Stimulating NIs\*\* stimulates a region of the nervous system by applying electric or magnetic pulses (Neurostimulation). Example:\
1. Cochlear implants: translate sound into electrical signals and send them to auditory nerve.\
2. Deep Brain Stimulators: Implanted electrodes implanted deep in the brain deliver electrical pulses to treat Parkinson's Disease.\
2. \*\*Recording NIs\*\* record and interpret nervous system activity. Example:\
1. BrainGate's BCI: An array of electrodes are implanted in an area of the brain that controls movement. It detects activating neurones when the intent to move arises in patients and thus allows to move prosthetic arms or cursor in screen.\
3. \*\*Record-Stimulate NIs\*\* both record and stimulate parts of the nervous system. Example:\
1. One of the current researches involves, combining record and stimulation to adjust motor muscle to assist movement.

\#\#\#\# Medical Applications of BCIs

1\. Control of Assistive Equipment\
1. assist patients who have lost motor and sensory function i.e. as a result of stroke, spinal cord injury and paralysis\
1. Examples: Exoskeletons, mechanised limbs, wheelchairs\
2. assist patients who have lost ability to speak\
1. Examples: Brain signal translating BCI help transcribe speech synthetically\
2. Improved Neurostimulation\
1. assist patients with drug-resistant Parkinson\'s\
1. Example: Deep Brain Stimulators\
1. Can lead to speech or balance impairment due to pre-programmed stimulation\
2. assist with adjusting stimulations\
1. Example: NeuroPace RNS is a responsive implantable BCI that applies brain stimulation to prevent epileptic seizures from occurring\
3. assist patients with mental health disorders, depression, responsive to the person's mental state
