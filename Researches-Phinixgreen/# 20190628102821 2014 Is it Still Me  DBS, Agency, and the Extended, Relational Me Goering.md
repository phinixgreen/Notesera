## Uncat

> "If what makes yourself who you are is only your brain, any intervention on it will touch upon and may fundamentally alter the essence of your personal dimension" (Mecacci and Haselager 2014, 35).\"

-   Goering offers a third perspective on viewing the brain \"a relational and dynamic interactive system (they cite Shoda et al. \[2002\] and Baylis \[2013\])\" or \"as extended beyond the brain and into cognitively assistive technologies like smartphones (e.g., Clark and Chalmers 1998).\"

-   Goering implies that this is different from external methods of cognitive affectation, such as influence of friends. Because multiple individuals can provide their own perspectives so as to assistantships the individual align their preferences with their goals. But with DBS, affectations are not easily traceable.

# Notes

Goering mentions \""maladaptations" to the implantation of deep brain stimulators (DBS).\"(P.50)

Goering also mentions the term "neurocentric materialism" which views that we are our brains and if our brain is altered via stimulation, then our identity is also threatened.

DBS is Deep Brain Stimulation According to Haselager (2014) the DBS users will not be sure whether DBS is interfering with their actions and emotions or not even in the knowledge of DBS implantation.

`Thoughts: Goering's conclusion indicates that DBS could become an extension of our identity. Although external, removal of it could reverse our stable sense of identity, as it does while incorporating into our daily activities.`
