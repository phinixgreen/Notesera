\# Notes

\#\# Introduction: Dual-Use Neurotechnology

\> \"In the ethics of (bio)technology, the dual-use problem refers primarily to the cooptation of civilian technology for military aims. This expression is also used to refer to the possibility of utilizing the same technology for both beneficial (e.g., clinical) applications and harmful misuse (e.g., bioterrorism).\" (Ienca, Jotterand & Elger, 2018, p. 269)

\- According to Ienca, Jotterand & Elger (2018, p. 269), Dual-use problem in bioethics refers to harmful and the useful use of biotech, or parallel uses of biotech in military and civilian platforms.

\> \"Tennison and Moreno (2012) have extensively reviewed the domain of neurotechnology tools with applications in both civilian and national security contexts with special focus on projects funded via the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Their state-of-the-art review identified three main categories of dual-use neurotechnology: brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), neurotechnologies for warfighter enhancement, and neurotechnological systems for deception detection and interrogation (Tennison and Moreno, 2012).\" (Ienca, Jotterand & Elger, 2018, p. 269)

\- Review by Tennison and Moreno (2012) suggests that dual-use neurotech, both civilian and military uses, focus on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), neurotech for warfighter enhancement and neurotech for deception detection and interrogatory purposes (Ienca, Jotterand & Elger, 2018, p. 269).

\> \"non-invasive direct-to-consumer BCIs are gaining increasing popularity as portable (often smart- phone-compatible) tools for device control, self-neuromonitoring, and personalized entertainment.\
Using the same technological paradigm, national security uses of BCI include the acquisition of neural information gathered from warfighters' brains to adaptively modify their equipment and the development of Threat Warning Systems that convert sub-conscious, neurological responses to danger into consciously available information (Miranda et al., 2015).\" (Ienca, Jotterand & Elger, 2018, p. 269)

\- Ienca, Jotterand & Elger (2018, p. 269) maintains that non-invasive consumer grade BCIs are available with use cases of device-control, self-neuromonitoring and personalized entertainment. Same technology is used in warfighting equipment modulation for better usage.

\> \"The dual-use problem is often presented as an ethical dilemma since it identifies a conflict between two fundamental ethical duties: the promotion of good and the prevention of possible collateral harm, e.g., between the promotion of health through effective clinical applications and the provision of resources for the killing of civilians through military operations. \" (Ienca, Jotterand & Elger, 2018, p. 270)

\- According to Ienca, Jotterand & Elger (2018, p. 270) the dual-use problem is often presented as an ethical dilemma because it manifests itself as a conflict between two ethical duties the prevention of bad such as military arsenalisation and the promotion of good such as clinical applications.

\> \"The dual-use character of neurotechnology makes it also a potential target for non-State actors.\"(Ienca, Jotterand & Elger, 2018, p. 270)

\- According to Ienca, Jotterand & Elger (2018, p. 270) the dual use character makes the civilians a target for non-state actors.

\#\# The Bidirectional Character of Dual Use in Neurotechnology

\> \"As dual use appears inherent to neurotechnology, the progressive increase in the number of civilian---both clinical and consumer-grade---neurotechnology applications will likely determine a proportionate increase in dual-use opportunities.\" (Ienca, Jotterand & Elger, 2018, p. 270)

\- Ienca, Jotterand & Elger (2018, p. 270) believes the progressive increase in the number of civilian both clinical and consumer grade neurotech will increase dual use opportunities.

\> \"In some circumstances, dual-use in neurotechnology can generate a circular dynamic.\" (Ienca, Jotterand & Elger, 2018, p. 270)

\- Ienca, Jotterand & Elger (2018, p. 270) believes that the dual-use in neurotech can lead to a circular dynamic between military and civilian applications.

\#\# A Global Ban on Dual-Use Neurotechnology? From Applied Ethics to Policy

\> \"The emerging risks associated with dual-use issues in neurotechnology have led scholars to take a critical stance against national defense and security involvement in neuroscience research.\" (Ienca, Jotterand & Elger, 2018, p. 271)

\- Ienca, Jotterand & Elger (2018, p. 271) states that dual use issues have led the scholars taking a stand against military use cases.

\> \"In light of population aging, the global burden of neurological disorders and the bidirectional dynamics of dual-use issues in neurotechnology, we identify a strategic and global health benefit in continuing research in defense-funded neurotechnology to successfully meet the grand challenges ahead in mental health and neurological care.\" (Ienca, Jotterand & Elger, 2018, p. 271)

\- Ienca, Jotterand & Elger (2018, p. 271) identify that military use cases can only be accepted if the funding is used for civilian benefits.

\#\# The Need for a Neurosecurity Framework

\> \"we identify an urgent need for increased monitoring and careful risk assessment in the context of dual-use neurotechnology.\" (Ienca, Jotterand & Elger, 2018, p. 271)

\- Ienca, Jotterand & Elger (2018, p. 271) urge that dual-use of neurotechnology needs urgent monitoring.

\> \"neurodevices have the capacity to access and modify the neural correlates of mental processes, their misuse by malevolent actors could expose individuals to greater risks associated to their mental dimension.\" (Ienca, Jotterand & Elger, 2018, p. 271)

\- Ienca, Jotterand & Elger (2018, p. 271) maintains that neurodevices have the capacity to interfere with an individual\'s neural correlates of mental processes and thus expose them to further abuse.

\> \"Legal scholars have argued that certain neuroweapons might be incompatible with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) as they ''ultimately disrupt the premise of responsibility under IHL'' (Noll, 2014). \" (Ienca, Jotterand & Elger, 2018, p. 272)

\- According to Noll (2014), Legal scholars have argued that some neuroweapons are incompatible with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) because they disrupt the presmise of responsibility under IHL. (Ienca, Jotterand & Elger, 2018, p. 272)

\> \"Similarly, it should be considered how dual-use neurotechnology relates to human rights such as autonomy, privacy, and mental or physical integrity.\" (Ienca, Jotterand & Elger, 2018, p. 272)

\- Ienca, Jotterand & Elger (2018, p. 272) argues that dual-use of neurotech relates to human rights to autonomy, privacy and mental or physical integrity.

\> \"A possible candidate is the protection of mental integrity. Although mental integrity is protected by the EU's Charter of fundamental rights (Article 3), this right is conceptualized as a guarantee for accessible mental health services. No specific protection, however, is stipulated against unauthorized intrusions into a person's neural computation through the use of neurotechnology, even if such intrusions result in physical or mental harm to the victim.\" (Ienca, Jotterand & Elger, 2018, p. 272)

\- Ienca, Jotterand & Elger (2018, p. 272) states that mental integrity should be protected and that in EU\'s Charter of Fundamental Rights Article 3, this right is only protected by guarantee of accessible mental health and no specific mentions about intrusion into neural computations.

\> \"Other possible candidates include the right to psychological continuity, which intends to protect the continuity of personal identity from unconsented exogenous alteration (Ienca and Andorno, 2017).\"

\- Ienca and Andorno (2017) have maintained that the right to Psychological Continuity is important for protection from the dual use of Neurotech.

\> \"Second, codes of ethical conduct need to be developed to maximize the benefits of military neuroscience while minimizing the risks for individuals and communities \... In particular, clinical trials must (1) be preceded by corroborated evidence of safety and effectiveness in animal, in vitro, and computational models, (2) prioritize subjects with treatment-resistant conditions, whose symptoms elude conventional therapies, (3) demonstrably exclude unintended collateral consequences on non-targeted brain functions, and (4) follow rigorous procedures for the obtainment of informed consent and IRB approval.\" (Ienca, Jotterand & Elger, 2018, p. 272)

\- Ienca, Jotterand & Elger (2018, p. 272) proposes that ethical conduct to maximize military benefits and minimize risk and harm in civilian use cases should include safety and effectiveness in animal, in vitro and in computation trails, prioritize subjects with treatment resistant conditions, demonstrate and exclude unintended consequences and follow informed consent and IRB approval.

\> \"a neurosecurity framework should raise awareness among neuroscientists, neuroengineers, and clinicians about dual use.\" (Ienca, Jotterand & Elger, 2018, p. 272)

\- Ienca, Jotterand & Elger (2018, p. 272) also proposes that a neurosecurity framework should be established to promote awareness about the dual use of neurotech among scientists.

\> \"'they may receive funding from national security agencies, neuroscientists may not consider how their work contributes to warfare'' (Tennison and Moreno, 2012).\"(Ienca, Jotterand & Elger, 2018, p. 273)

\- Tennison and Moreno (2012) contends that such a framework is necessary because the dual-use may be excarbated through the avoidance by neuroscientist that their work is not contributing to the warfare, as in case of the BRAIN Inititive which does not consider the terms \"dual use\" or \"weaponization\" despite receiving funding from DARPA. (Ienca, Jotterand & Elger, 2018, p. 273)

\> \"In parallel, public engagement strategies such as citizen science initiatives, hackathons, and open-development platforms like Open BCI ( \[http://openbci.com/\](http://openbci.com/) ) must be sustained and incentivized.\" (Ienca, Jotterand & Elger, 2018, p. 273)

\- The Authors contend that public funded projects such as Open BCI should be encouraged.

\- The authors also applaud the Human Brain Project and their ethical and policy requirements. They highlight that in 2010 neuroscientists from 17 different countries signed a pledge which was designed as a course of action.
