\#\# \# Hmm... Seems like psychology and Behaviourism had a common root. I might be wrong.

\#\# Here's what's important:

\< Publicly observable behavior\> IS a PROOF of Mentality

\#\# What is Behavior?

It says

iv\. Actions not involving overt bodily motions: for example, judging, reasoning, guessing, calculating, deciding, intending. (Kim 2011, p.67)

is a kind of mental act, therefore, an instance of behavior.

Also, \*\*physiological reactions\*\* such as breathing and pulse, \*\*bodily movement\*\* such as walking and moving your hand and actions involving \*\*bodily motions\*\* such as going to a concert plus any \*\*mental acts\*\* count as behavior.

\#\# Logical Behaviourism: A Positivist Argument

\*\*Logical Behaviourism\*\* is also known as \*\*Analytical Behaviorism\*\* or \*\*Philosophical Behaviorism.\*\*

Logical Behaviorism II. Every meaningful psychological expression can be defined solely in terms of behavioral and physical expressions, that is, expressions referring to behavioral and physical phenomena (Kim 2011, p.68)

This means (I think) - psychological expression such as "He is in pain" can be described just using behavior (Ouch!) and physical phenomenon (neural activation)?

\#\# An argument for accepting logical behaviorism?

P1. The meaning of a sentence can be verified using our senses. (Senses correspond to our inner workings. \"A cat is a can of tin"? - doesn't make sense to me)

P2. The meaning of a sentence can be understood by many speakers. This means they have the same verification method for the sentence. (if I say I am a Student. You get that I am saying that I am calling myself a Student. So you got me right?)

P3. \"Only Behavioural and physical phenomena are publicly observable" (Kim 2011, p. 69)

C1. Therefore, if someone got the meaning of the same sentence, then they have access to the verification method of that meaning, that means that they have similar inner workings/sense states.

\#\# DIFFICULTIES WITH BEHAVIOURAL DEFINITIONS

Dispositions: \< the cause to behave in a certain way \>\
\*\*\*Ex: Pain is a disposition to wince\*\*\*

"Desire-Belief-Action Principle (DBA). If a person desires that p and believes that doing A is an optimal way to secure that p, she will do A."? (Kim 2011, p.73)

If I think wincing is the best way to ease pain then I will wince when I am in pain.

\#\# DO PAINS ENTAIL PAIN BEHAVIOR?

So wincing is a kind of pain behavior?

What about \*\*super-stoics\*\* and \*\*super-Spartans\*\*? They don't wince or cry when in pain. How do we know that they are in pain if they don't have pain behavior?

Then, Pain doesn't always entail Pain-behavior?

But it seems dogs and cats, animals, in general, has pain expressing behavior.

Weak Behavior Entailment Thesis. For any pain-capable species there is a certain behaviour type B such that, for that species, being in pain entails a propensity to emit behaviour of type B. (Kim 2011, p. 77)

\#\# ONTOLOGICAL BEHAVIORISM

This is a kind of radical behaviorism.

"A radical behaviorist may claim that there are no mental facts over and above actual and possible behavioral facts, and that inner mental events do not exist, and that if they did, they are of no consequence. This is ontological behaviorism: Existentially, our mentality consists solely in behaviors and behavioral dispositions; there is nothing more. This, therefore, is a form of psychological eliminativism, the view that mentality as ordinarily conceived is as misguided and defunct as the phlogiston theory of combustion and the neo-vitalist theory of entelechies as the â€œprinciple of life." (Kim 2011, p.78)

This is basically claiming that the behavior itself is the pain. To wince is the pain. This is not exactly like saying- Pain is the cause of wincing. (Kim 2011, p.78)

A dualist can say that Pain- the non-physical phenomenon is the cause of wincing- a physical phenomenon.

But ontological behaviorism does not entail logical behaviorism.\
Why?\
- Logical Behaviourism tries to find pain behavior for explaining the pain.\
- Ontological Behaviourism may say no need to find pain, the \"neural-physical\" states are enough to explain pain.

here's some philosophers on feelings-

Daniel Dennett has urged that our concept of a private qualitative state (qualia) is saddled with conditions that cannot be simultaneously satisfied, and that, as a result, there can be nothing that corresponds to the traditional idea of a private inner episode. Paul Churchland and Stephen Stich have argued that beliefs, desires, and other intentional states as conceived in folk? psychology will go the way of phlogiston and entelechies as systematic, scientific psychology makes progress. (Kim 2011, p.80)

\#\# THE REAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PAIN AND PAIN BEHAVIOR

• What is the relationship between pain and pain behavior

• What is the relationship between a standard meter and a standard

Thought: I think pain behavior is proof that pain is a real thing, although it is not a necessary evidence of pain.

\#\# BEHAVIORISM IN PSYCHOLOGY

B.F Skinner's \*\*Radical Behaviourism\*\* or \*\*Methodological Behaviourism\*\* can be defined as following the principle-

\(I\) The only admissible evidence for the science of psychology is observable behavioral data" that is, data concerning the observable physical behavior of organisms (Kim 2011, p.83). This means that behavior is the only way of understanding what goes on inside the mind.

\(II\) Psychological theories must not invoke the internal states of psychological subjects; that is, psychological explanations must not appeal to internal states of organisms, nor should references to such states occur in deriving predictions about behavior. (Kim 2011, p.84) So we should deal only with observable states, not internal states when formulating psychological theories?

\(III\) Psychological theories must make no reference to inner mental states in formulating psychological explanations. (Kim 2011, p.85)

But if we exclude private mental states from psychological theory, this means they have no causal-explanatory role in relation to behavior. Meaning, mental states do not interact with behaviors causally and cannot be explained in such manner.

\#\# WHY BEHAVIOR MATTERS TO MIND

Summary of the discussion -

1\. The brain is ontological- that is, - the existential base of the mind.\
2. The brain, and perhaps the mind also, is the cause of the behavior.\
3. Behavior is the semantic foundation of mental language. It is what fixes the meanings of our mental/psychological expressions.\
4. Behavior is the primary, almost exclusive, evidence for the attribution of mental states to other beings with minds. Our knowledge of other minds depends primarily on the observation of behavior. (Kim 2011, p.87)

In short, behavior is evidence that there is a mind.

Question: But What if something that produces behavior without a mind? Like philosophical zombies? Or Robots?
