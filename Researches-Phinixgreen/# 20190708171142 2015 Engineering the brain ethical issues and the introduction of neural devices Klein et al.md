\# Engineering the brain: ethical issues and the introduction of neural devices

\\\[p.27-29\\\]

\#\#\# Identity

Klein et. Al argues that Neural devices become a part of our identity through overexposed usage.

\* Clark and Chalmers\' Extended Mind Hypothesis is mentioned

\\\[p.29-30\\\]

\#\#\# Normality

Normal Daniels\' Normal Functioning is important because it will be difficult to define whether BCI usage is a treatment or an enhancement. What counts as a baseline for brain\'s normal functioning or enhancement will also be hard to answer.

\\\[p.31-32\\\]

\#\#\# Privacy

The implication is that there will be neural devices as consumer product. And like any other product these devices will need monitoring for upgrade or bug fixing. Who will own the neural data? And who will ensure the security?

-Brainotyped data may be stolen. -Digital Prosthetic data may be stolen.

Denning et al. is mentioned for neurosecurity- "the protection of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of neural devices from malicious parties with the goal of preserving the safety of a person's neural mechanisms, neural computation, and free will"

Free will is interesting because someone with access to BCI seem to turn into a free agent into a controlled cyborg.

\#\#\#\# Private information sharing

\> \"something that often comprises our sense of self, has become potentially public: available for access, interference, or inquisition.\" \\(Klein et. Al, p.32\\)\
\>\
\> \"the potential accessibility problem, or figuring out where to draw the boundary between public and private given the very existence of devices that collect and analyze neurological data\" \\(Klein et. Al, p.32\\)

\#\# Notes

1\. I am interested in the privacy and identity aspect of this paper.\
2. I am interested in this aspect from another perspective. Web 2.0 has shown that people hardly care for their own privacy when given access to more information. If everyone starts sharing their neural data in a hypothetical neuromedia then individual privacy and identity will be at stake. One could for instance share one\'s arm publicly in a dare for fun with friends. Such situations will give rise to highly complicated legal issues for which the present legislation is hardly prepared. The usage rights and rules should be formulated and closely monitored as the devices are developed and deployed in consumer market.

\#\#\# Summary

Authors aruge that Neural Devices will be available soon and they will challenge the standard notion of identity, normality, authority, privacy and justice.
