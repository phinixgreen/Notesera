Let\'s say Allen and Zeta are two individuals who happen to have access to brain to brain interfacing.

How does the merger take place? How do they start to perceive the environment? How does shared memory and senses help them navigate the world? Does it confound or enhance their perception. Does this mean they start sharing consciousness?

I argue that consciousness from third person perspective, seems unitary but it is actually modular in nature. That is different parts of brain are conscious in their own way just because they are located inside a cranium they have adapted to identify themselves as a single entity. If this can be sufficiently established then one could as well argue that two distinct individual consciousness is mergeable because of the same reason. It is not a merger of conscious entities but merger of conscious modules. An upshot of this view is that modules themselves are not discrete, they are breakable into single memory cells which this theory serves to establish has protoconsciousness.
