## Summary

### \[164\]

-   "A probabilistic automaton is a generalized Turing machine whose machine table includes instructions associated with finite positive probabilities less than or equal to one." (P.164)
-   The Functional State Identity Theory (FSIT) assumes that organisms are describable as probabilisitic automata and that two organisms can have type identical (functional) psychological states. (P. 164-165)

### \[165\]

-"there is an obvious generalization of the notion of a probabilistic automaton in which it is thought of as having a separate input tape on which an \"oracle\" can print symbols during a computation. FSIT presupposes an interpretation of this generalization in which sensory transducers take the place of the \"oracle\" and in which outputs are thought of as instructions to motor transducers. Such an interpretation must be intended if a description of an organism is to provide a model of the mental operations of the organism." (P.165)

Block and Fodor try to outline how the Probabilistic Automata is realized in Physicality of organisms. A Turing machine has tapes. Probabilistic automaton has tapes. In Turing machine symbols are printed on the tape. And same with probabilistic automaton. Their attempt is to sketch how the automaton is physically implemented. The proposal from FSIT is that sensory converters converts sensory inputs into symbols and then print onto the machine tape of the automaton. This interpretation, Block and Fodor insists, must be taken in to consideration to provide a model of operations of mentality of an organism. (P.165)

### \[166\]

"FSIT claims that the description of a system are in correspondence with the types of psychological states that the system can be in."

According to Block and Fodor, FSIT's claims imply that the psychological (functional) types are "in correspondence" with the machine descriptions of the automaton.

"FSIT, unlike either behaviorism or physicalism, is not an ontological theory: that is, it is neutral about what token psy- chological states are, in that as far as FSIT is concerned, among the systems to which psychological predicates are applicable (and which therefore have descriptions) might be included persons, material objects, souls, and so forth. This last point suggests how FSIT might meet certain of the kinds of difficulties we raised against physicalism and behaviorism. Just as FSIT abstracts from considerations of the ontological status of the systems which have descriptions, so too it abstracts from physical differences between systems which have their descriptions in common. As Putnam has remarked, \"the same Turing machine (from the standpoint of the machine table) may be physically realized in a potential infinity of ways\" (\"The Mental Life of Some Machines,\" p. 27i), and FSIT allows us to state type-identity conditions on psychological states which are neutral as between such different realizations." (P.166)

-   FSIT is not an ontological theory
-   Token physical states can be applied to persons, materials, souls and so forth
-   Because of this, FSIT abstracts away from the relation between physical systems which have functional description in common
-   Type identity means that same type functional state can be realized across many realisers.

### \[167\]

"We remarked that the behaviorist is committed to the view that two organisms are in the same psychological state whenever their behaviors and/or behavioral dispositions are identical; and that this theory is implausible to the extent that the behaviors and the behavioral dispositions of an organism are the effects of interactions between its psychological states. But FSIT allows us to distinguish between psychological states not only in terms of their behavioral consequences but also in terms of the character of their interconnections.

This is because the criterion of identity for machine table states acknowledges their relations to one another as well as their relations to inputs and outputs. Thus, FSIT can cope with the characteristic indirectness of the relation between psychological states and behavior. Indeed, FSIT allows us to see how psychological states which have no behavioral expressions might nevertheless be distinct." (P.167)

-   Behaviorist conception holds that is that two organism are in type identical states, when their behaviour and disposition is identical.
-   Because identity of machine table states acknowledge relation to input and outputs.
-   FSIT allows for distinguishing between psychological states not only in terms of behavioural consequences but also in terms of interconnections.
