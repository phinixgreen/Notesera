Block and Fodor (1972, p.161) contends that If \"the conceptual possibility that psychological predicates could apply to artifacts" \[then\] "it seems likely that given any psychophysical correlation which holds for an organism, it is possible to build a machine which is similar to the organism psychologically, but physiologically sufficiently different from the organism that the psychophysical correlation does not hold for the machine"
