description: \>- Clark and Chalmers proposes a third theory to the boundary between the mind and the world

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Introduction

> \"Where does the mind stop and the rest of the world begin? The question invites two standard replies. Some accept the boundaries of skin and skull, and say that what is outside the body is outside the mind. Others are impressed by argument suggesting that the meaning of our words \'just ain\'t in the head\', and hold that this externalism about meaning carries over into an externalism about mind. We propose to pursue a third position. We advocate a very different sort of externalism: an active externalism, based on the active role of the environment in driving cognitive processes.\" (Clark and Chalmers, 1998, p.7)

### Two Replies to Extended Mind

1.  No mind outside the body

> \"what is outside the body is outside the mind.\"

2.  Externalism of meaning of words carries over to Externalism of mind

> the meaning of our words \'just ain\'t in the head\'

#### Clark and Chalmers\' Third Proposal

**Active Externalism:** Environment plays active role in cognitive processes
