\"The point against the Turing Test conception of intelligence is not that the Aunt Bubbles machine wouldn\'t process information the way we do, but rather that the way it does process informationis unintelligent despite its performance in the Turing Test. Ultimately, the problem with the Turing test for theoretical purposes is that it focuses on performance rather than on competence. Of course, performance is evidence for competence, but the core of our understanding of the mind lies with mental competence, not behavioral performance.\"

\"Think of the human mind as represented by an intelligent being in the head, a \"homunculus\". Think of this homunculus as being composed of smaller and stupider homunculi, and each of these being composed of still smaller and still stupider homunculi until you reach a level of completely mechanical homunculi.\"

\"The irrelevance of hardware realization to computational description. These gates work in very different ways, but they are nonetheless computationally equivalent.\"

\"the method of functional analysis that explains intelligent processes byreducing them to unintelligent mechanical processesdoes not explain intentionality.\"

\"The parts of an intentional system can be just as intentional as the whole system. (See Fodor (1981)\"

\"One problem with this idea is that even if this theory works for \"observation sentences\" such as \` This is yellow\', it is hard to see how it could work for \"theoretical sentences.\"\"
