\# Preliminaries

\*\*Treatment\*\* : Prevent or cure condition that we view as a disease.

\*\*Enhancement\*\*: Interventions to improve condition what we view as normal function.

\*\*Normal Function\*\*: "normal functioning" is based on the interpretation of the requirements of fair equality of opportunity by Rawls \\(1971\\).

\*\*Rawls' interpretation\*\*: Certain human traits are morally irrelevant and people should be judged by their capacity to perform social activities. The past has distorted these capacities for everyone in different ways, so to compensate everyone special practices should be deployed to ensure equal social participation.

\*\*Normal Functioning\*\*:

\> "disease and disability, both physical and mental, are construed as adverse departures from or impairments of species-typical normal functional organization or "normal functioning," \\(Daniels, 2000, p.314\\)

Human capacity to perform social activities are distorted by the history of natural lottery. To compensate for this unequal biological capacity, special medical intervention should be deployed to ensure everyone is close to a standard biological capacity and talent.

\*\*Baseline\*\*: The point for starting medical intervention for everyone. Alternatively, a baseline is a standard which allows everyone equal biological capacity if in vicinity.
