Hilary Putnam in his response to the limitations of logical behaviourism and type-identity theory formulated the Machine Functionalist (Putnam, 1967) theory.

According to Logical Behaviorism mental states are behavioral dispostions. i.e. the tendency to wince when on pain. According to Type-Identity theory mental states are brain states. i.e. the pain that is experienced by the brain

According to Functionalism, mental states are functional states. Functional states are a combination of sensory input, motor output and appropriate mental states. Only the relevant state functions with appropriate relation with input and output and other states. According to Kim (2011, p.147) "Machine functionalists claim that we can think of the mind as a Turing machine (or a probabilistic automaton)." Putnam\'s Probabilistic Automata is similar to Turing machines but are not deterministic in their transition from one state to another. He explains that ---

"The operations of a probabilistic automaton are not deterministic; the current internal state of the machine and the symbol it is scanning do not---do not always, at any rate---together uniquely determine what the machine will do next." (Kim 2011, p.144)

According to Putnam (1975, p. 433) "The notion of a Probabilistic Automaton is defined similarly to a Turing Machine, except that the transitions between \'states\' are allowed to be with various probabilities rather than being \'deterministic'." In a generalised view of probabilistic Automaton, specific sets of sensory inputs are specified by 'every possible combination' of initial state and a distinct set of 'sensory inputs'. An instruction determines the probability of the following state and also the probabilities of 'motor outputs'.

Thus, a mental activity, according to Putnam is a Probabilistic Automaton. He connects this to CCTM by proposing that machine states are also part of the automaton, therefore, a machine state can either lead to an output or another machine state.
