# Making Sense of Mind-Brain Distinction

20200323171140

## Intro

In this post I discuss, how the theories of mind have been running in curious metaphysical circularity and how it impacts our world view.

Why Mind-Brain Distinction? What is the traditional use? Start with defining the brain. Start defining the mind and now it gets problematic?

## Theories of Mind and Brain

### Some theories hold that Mind and Brain are two distinct entities.

This is the easiest solution to mind and brain distinction. By accepting that the mind and brain are two different things or substances, one accepts that brain being physical and tangible has certain properties that are different from the properties that the mind has. A common example of this is the soul-body distinction, that the brain is the body, mind is the soul.

How does the physical substance entity like brain interact with a non-physical substance or such as mind? Also ask where does the mind reside? Does it reside in the brain, the physical world?

A Mind-Brain Dualist who hold that mind and brain are two different substances cannot answer to both of this questions simultaenously.

Consider this, if mind resides in the body, then it interacts with the body physically therefore the body is able to hold the mind.

P= Mind resides in the body Q= Mind Interacts with the body

If P then Q

Not Q therefore Not P

But there seems to no way of telling that mind interacts with the body. May be, mind doesn\'t reside in the body?

But how can it be, I know that my mind is here with me and not somewhere else. May be, the theory is somewhat problematic then.

#### Alternative Theory: Mind and brain are different properties of Physical susbstance

Let us improvise a bit. What if the mind is indeed with us, but it has non-physical properties. That is Brain has physical properties, and mind is its non-physical properties.

This view is called epiphenomenalism. Epiphenomenalists hold that the mind is an epiphenomenon of the brain. That is the mind cannot causally affect the brain, but it can arise from physical activities.

To make sense, think of the horror movies, When you scream, it\'s your body that reacts to the horror scenes, and your mind just experiences the fear. In other words, your fear is just an epiphenomenon.

If this is true, then one accepts this then one also accepts that mind has no free will. If it does not have any free will, how can I thinking that I need to survive, go on to perform a variety of mental (as well as physical tasks) to earn living?

### Some theories hold that mind and brain are not two distinct entities.
