Chapter Extract 1

" Utilitarianism is a universal emulator: it implies that we should lie, cheat, steal, even appropriate Aristotle, when that is what brings about the best outcomes. In some cases and in some worlds it is best for us to focus as precisely as possible on individual acts. In other cases and worlds it is best for us to be concerned with character traits. Global environmental change leads to concerns about character because the best results will be produced by generally uncoupling my behavior from that of others. Thus, in this case and in this world, utilitarians should be virtue theorists." (Jamieson, 2007)

Summary / Paraphrase 1

Jamieson mentions Utilitarianism as a universal emulator which provides direction to best outcomes for individual acts. However, he maintains that in order to produce the best outcome for global environment character traits (virtues) could be vital. Therefore, \"utilitarians should be virtue theorists.\" (Jamieson, 2007)

Chapter Extract 2

"I begin with an assumption which few would deny, but about which many are in denial: human beings are transforming Earth in ways that are devastating for other forms of life, future human beings, and many of our human contemporaries. The epidemic of extinction now underway is an expression of this. So is the changing climate. Ozone depletion, which continues at a very high rate, is potentially the most lethal expression of these transformations, for without an ozone layer, no life on Earth could exist. Call anthropogenic mass extinctions, climate change and ozone depletion 'the problem of global environmental change' (or 'the problem' for short)." (Jamieson, 2007)

Summary / Paraphrase 2

Jamieson begins his argument by taking 'the problem of global environmental change' or \'the problem' in short, as a true premise.(Jamieson, 2007,p.160)

Chapter Extract 3

"Philosophers in their professional roles have by and large remained silent about the problem. There are many reasons for this. I believe that one reason is because it is hard to know what to say from the perspective of the reigning moral theories: Kantianism, contractarianism and common-sense pluralism" (Jamieson, 2007)

Summary / Paraphrase 3

Jamieson believes philosophers have remained silent about \'the problem\' because major moral theories such as Kantianism, contractarianism and common-sense pluralism cannot satisfyingly provide any answer to it. (Jamieson, 2007)

Chapter Extract 4

"Consider first Kantianism. Christine Korsgaard writes that it is 'nonaccidental' that utilitarians are 'obsessed' with 'population control' and 'the preservation of the environment'.3 For 'a basic feature of the consequentialist outlook still pervades and distorts our thinking: the view that the business of morality is to bring something about' \[sic\]. Korsgaard leaves the impression that a properly conceived moral theory would have little to say about the environment, for such a theory would reject this false picture of the 'business of morality'." (Jamieson, 2007)

Summary / Paraphrase 4

Jamieson believes that Christine Korsgaard, in her view of utilitarianism being obsessed with population control and preservation of the environment, exemplifies that a properly conceived moral theory would have little to say about the environment, \"for such a theory would reject this false picture of the 'business of morality\'" which is to produce an outcome. (Jamieson, 2007)

Chapter Extract 5

" The silence of Kantianism on this issue is related to two deep features of the theory: its individualism, and its emphasis on the interior." (Jamieson, 2007)

\"But if our primary concern is how we should act in the face of global environmental change, then we\
need a theory that is seriously concerned with what people bring about, rather than a theory that is (as we might say) 'obsessed' with the purity of the will." (Jamieson, 2007)

Summary / Paraphrase 5

Jamieson argues that Kantianism remains silent on the issue because of its emphasis on individualism and interior.(Jamieson, 2007)

Jamieson also argues that if the primary concern is to fight 'the problem' then a theory is required that adequately addresses the outcome rather than being \'obsessed with the purity of will' (Jamieson, 2007).

Chapter Extract 6

"Contractarianism has difficulties in addressing environmental problems in general and global environmental change in particular for at least three reasons. First, it generally has a hard time coping with large-scale cooperation problems and the difficulties with assurance to which they give rise. Second, contractarianism has a difficult time with negative 'externalities' -- the consequences for me (for example) when you and another consenting adult agree to produce and consume some substance that pollutes the air. It may be possible to overcome these problems, at least in principle, through various revisions of the core theory. But the deeper problem with contractarianism is that it\
excludes from primary moral consideration all thosewho are not parties to the relevant agreements." (Jamieson, 2007)

Summary / Paraphrase 6

According to Jamieson, Contractarianism faces difficulties in addressing \'the problem' because of insecurities as to \'large-scale cooperation problems and negative 'externalities' which is harm caused by parties in contract to parties not considered in the contract. (Jamieson, 2007)

Chapter Extract 7

"Common-sense pluralism is hampered by its intrinsic conservatism. Although common-sense pluralists morally condemn obvious forms of bad behavior, they are ultimately committed to the view that\
most of what we do is perfectly acceptable. " (Jamieson, 2007)

\"they criticize utilitarianism for being too revisionist and utilitarians for being no fun.10 But what produces global environmental change is everyday behavior that is innocent from the perspective of common sense" (Jamieson, 2007)

Summary / Paraphrase 7

Jamieson maintains that Common-sense pluralism criticises utilitarianism for being revisionist and serious, because is intrinsically conservative about righteousness of actions but is blind to the fact that global environmental change is caused by everyday behaviours which are innocent from the perspective of common sense pluralism. (Jamieson, 2007)

Chapter Extract 8

"Deontologists might not consider global environmental change a moral problem because, on their view, moral problems center on what we intend to bring about, and no one intends to bring about global environmental change. Similarly, Kantians who reject the idea that 'the business of morality is to bring something about' might also have reason to exclude our problem from the domain of morality." (Jamieson, 2007)

Summary / Paraphrase 8

According to Jamieson Deontologists might not consider global environment as a moral problem because it is primarily concerned about the will rather than the action. (Jamieson, 2007)

Chapter Extract 9

"Utilitarianism takes the concern for consequences to the limit, and it is generally of interest\
to see where pure versions of various doctrines wind up leading us." (Jamieson, 2007)

"Korsgaard castigates utilitarianism for its environmental obsessions, many environmental philosophers see utilitarianism as a doctrine that celebrates consumption rather than preservation." (Jamieson, 2007)

"utilitarianism cannot account for the value of biodiversity, ecosystems or endangered species, and go on to condemn the theory for 'sentientism' and 'moral extensionism'.\"(Jamieson, 2007)

Summary / Paraphrase

Jamieson, in his evaluation of what other doctrines has to say about utilitarianism, mentions Korsgaard's skepticism of the doctrine because its conflicting nature. Jamieson explains that this conflict occurs because although it is obsessed with environmental preservation, utilitarianism "celebrates consumption rather than preservation", "cannot account for the value of biodiversity, ecosystems or endangered species" and has negative attitude towards sentientism and moral extensionism. (Jamieson, 2007)

Chapter Extract 10

"But utilitarianism has an important strength that is often ignored by its critics: it requires us to do what is best. This is why any objection that reduces to the claim that utilitarianism requires us to do what is not best, or even good, cannot be successful. Any act or policy that produces less than optimal consequences fails to satisfy the principle of utility. Any theory that commands us to perform such acts cannot be utilitarian\" (Jamieson, 2007)

Summary / Paraphrase 10

Jamieson then mentions that the requirement to do what is best to maintain its principle of utility is the most important strength of utilitarianism that deflects objections from other doctrines. (Jamieson, 2007)

Chapter Extract 11

"Part of what should be taken into account in answering this question is that global environmental change presents us with the world's biggest collective action problem. Together we produce bad outcomes that no individual acting alone has the power to produce or prevent." (Jamieson, 2007)

Summary / Paraphrase

Jamieson emphasizes that for utilitarians global environmental change is the "world's biggest collective action problem" and thus takes the collective consequential stance rather than individual utility maximization demand. (Jamieson, 2007)

Chapter Extract 12

"agents should minimize their own contributions to global environmental change and act in such away\
as to cause others to minimize their contributions as well." (Jamieson, 2007)

Summary / Paraphrase

For the individual consequential account, Jamieson prescribes that "agents should minimize their own contributions to global environmental change and act in such away as to cause others to minimize their contributions as well." (Jamieson, 2007)

Chapter Extract 13

"how should a utilitarian agent live in order to address the problem?" (Jamieson, 2007)

"a successful response would be non-contingency. Non-contingency requires agents to act in ways that minimize their contributions to global environmental change, and specifies that acting in this way should generally not be contingent on an agent's beliefs about the behavior of others." (Jamieson, 2007)

Summary / Paraphrase

Addressing how a utilitarian should respond to the dillemma of collective and individual action, Jamieson states that a successful response for agents could be to act on minimizing their contribution to the global environmental change without depending on the beliefs of behaviors of other agents. He calls this Non-contingency. (Jamieson, 2007)

Chapter Extract 14

"Others may say that the solution to our problem consists in developing collective or shared intentions of the right sort. One version of this view holds that individual agents need to form intentions 'to play one's part in a joint act' or to 'see themselves as working together \[sic\] to promote human well-being'." (Jamieson, 2007)

\"In this respect my account can be seen as complementary to, or even perhaps as part of, the project\
of investigating shared or collective intentions as solutions to collective action problems." (Jamieson, 2007)

Summary / Paraphrase

Jamieson believes that his account of non-contingency is complementary (or even worth investigating further) to the ideas of collective or shared intentions of players playing their part in a larger act of working together towards better change. (Jamieson, 2007)

Chapter Extract 15

"Thus, in the face of our problem, utilitarians should take virtues seriously. Focusing on the virtues helps to regulate and coordinate behavior, express and contribute to the constitution of community through space and time, and helps to create empathy, sympathy and solidarity among moral agents." (Jamieson, 2007)

\"The most serious problem with the idea that non-contingency should be an important part of a utilitarian theory of how to respond to our problem is that it is in tension with an underappreciated, but extremely important, general feature of utilitarianism: noncomplacency. Non-complacency refers to the fact that ways of life and patterns of action should be dynamically responsive to changing circumstances, taking advantage of unique opportunities to produce goodness, and always striving to do better." (Jamieson, 2007)

Summary / Paraphrase

Jamieson believes utilitarians should be virtue ethicists because "Focusing on the virtues helps to regulate and coordinate behavior, express and contribute to the constitution of community through space and time, and helps to create empathy, sympathy and solidarity among moral agents." (Jamieson, 2007)

Jamieson argues that the Utilitarian feature of Noncomplacency, which means that taking actions seriously to strive better, is at tension with the idea of non-contingency, which prescribes acting alone. (Jamieson, 2007)

Chapter Extract 16

"Non-complacency should lead a utilitarian to moral improvement in two ways. First, she should be sensitive to the fact that circumstances change. What is the best motivational set in an analog world may not be best in a digital one." (Jamieson, 2007)

Summary / Paraphrase

Jamieson argues that Non-complacency should help a utilitarian by making her sensitive to cicrucmstance changes such as the transition from analog to digital environment.

Chapter Extract 17

"If others are having a good time changing climate, destroying ozone and driving species to extinction, and the green cause is hopeless, then it appears that I am morally obliged to join in the fun." (Jamieson, 2007)

"The first argument concerns the decision process of a single agent; the second claims that the first argument generalizes to all similarly situated agents." (Jamieson, 2007)

Summary / Paraphrase 17

Jamieson mentions the common objection to non-contingency, that, if others are harming the environment, so should one be. Here, Jamieson argues that contingent generalization of a single agent is the root cause of all problems. (Jamieson, 2007)

Chapter Extract 18

"In the domain of global environmental change-relevant behavior, what we want is inflexible green behavior," (Jamieson, 2007)

"green virtues are those that utilitarians should try to exemplify in themselves and elicit in others, given the reality of global environmental change." (Jamieson, 2007)

"Green virtues fall into three categories: those that reflect existing values; those that draw on existing values but have additional or somewhat different content; and those that reflect new values. I call these three strategies of virtue-identification preservation, rehabilitation and creation." (Jamieson, 2007)

Summary / Paraphrase 18

Jamieson proposes inflexible non-contingengent green behavior of agents which he calls green virtues that "Utilitarians should try to exemplify in themselves and elicit in others." Jamieson categorizes these virtues into three categories- ones that reflect existing values, those with existing values but have additional/different content, those that reflect new values. He calls these three strategies respectively------ virtue-identification preservation, rehabilitation and creation." (Jamieson, 2007)

Chapter Extract 19

"Philosophically, we should ask when, not whether, utilitarians should be virtue theorists. Practically, we need to develop a catalog of the green virtues and identify methods for how best to inculcate them." (Jamieson, 2007)

Summary / Paraphrase

Jamieson concludes that utilitarians should be virtue theorists and through improvisation, enrich the catalog of green virtues and identify best methods to establish them (Jamieson, 2007)
