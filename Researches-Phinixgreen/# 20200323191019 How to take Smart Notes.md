# How to Take Smart Notes

## 10 Principles to Revolutionise Note-taking and Writing

### Principle 1: Writing is not the outcome of thinking. It is the

medium in which thinking takes place

Thinking requires writing in elaboration, like translating, rewriting, comparing and contrasting to describe the idea that we have come across. By elaborating the idea, in writing, we get deep into the topic itself

### Principle 2: Do your work as if writing is the only thing that matters

### Principle 3: No one starts from scratch

### Principle 4: Our tools and techniques are only as valuable as the workflow

### Principle 5: Standardisation enables creativity

### Principle 6: Our work only gets better when exposed to high quality

feedback

### Principle 7: Work on multiple simultaneous projects

### Principle 8: Organise your notes by context

### Principle 9: Always follow the most interesting path

### Principle 10: Save contradictory ideas
