\# Is the Treatment-Enhancement Distinction a Natural Baseline?

Daniels' concern is "primarily with how the central debate affects the ethical implications of the distinction, not the fine details of debates in the philosophy of biology." \\(Daniels, 2000, p.10\\)

\> "the natural baseline has become a focal point for convergence in our public conception of what we owe each other by way of medical assistance or healthcare protection." \\(?\\)

Questions: If Diseases cannot be distinguished from enhancement, should enhancements be included in medical care available to all individuals? if so what is the baseline standard for that enhancement? If everyone is of the same height, who is tall then?

\> "The baseline that emerges over time is most likely one that is compatible with the demands of justice in a pluralist society."

\*\*Our views of disease\*\*: Historical evidences have suggested that some identification of diseases can be socially constructed. i.e. Masturbation, Homosexuality, Left handedness.

\*\*Medical view of disease\*\*: Life threatening and well-being obstructing physical and medical condition.

\*\*Distinguishing between Medical view of disease treatment and enhancement is difficult because our socially constructed view of disease interferes with the idea of enhancement\*\*: Daniels mentions the following hard cases.
