Blake Snyder Beat Sheet

1\. Opening Image: A snapshot of the main character's problem before the adventure begins

2\. Set up: expand on the time "before" snapshot. Present the character's world as it is and what is missing in their life.

3\. Theme Stated(happens during the set up): What your story is about, the message, the truth. This is spoken to the main character or in their presence. but they do no understand the truth. Not until they have some personal experience and context to support it.

4\. Catalyst: The moment where life as it is changes. The "before" world is no more, change is under way.

5\. Debate: Change is scary and for a moment, or brief number of moments, the main character doubts the journey they must take. Can I face this challenge? Should I go at all? The last chance for the hero to back out.

6\. Break into Two (Choosing act two): The main character makes a choice and journey begins. The "thesis" world is left behind and enter an upside-down, opposite world of act two.

7\. B Story: This is when there is a discussion about the theme, the nugget of truth. This discussion is between the main character and the love interest. B-Story is usually a love story.

8\. The promise of the premise: This is where the main character explores the new world and the audience is entertained by the premise they have been promised.

9\. Midpoint: This is the moment when the character gets everything they think they want. But not everything we think we want is what we actually need in the end.

10\. Bad guys close in: Doubt, jealousy, fear, foes, both physical and emotional regroup to defeat the main character's goal. And the great situation disintegrates.

11\. All is lost- The opposite moment from the midpoint: The moment the character realizes that they've lost everything. The initial goal now looks even more impossible than before. And here, something or someone dies. It can be physical or emotional. But the death of something old makes way for something new to be born.

12\. Dark night of the soul - The main character hits bottom and wallows in hopelessness. It is the why have you forsaken me god? moment. The character mourns the loss of what has died, the dream, the goal, the mentor character, the love of your life. But he must fall completely before he can pick himself up and try again.

13\. Break into Three (Choosing act three): Thanks to a fresh idea, new inspiration, last minute thematic advice from the BStory the hero makes sense of the truth of the theme, and chooses to try again.

14\. Finale: This time the main character incorporates the theme, the nugget of truth now makes sense to them.\
15. Final Image: Opposite of the opening image, proving visually, that change has occurred within the character.
