> Leuthardt et al. (2004, p.6) describes Brain--computer interfaces (BCIs) as a technology that \"enable users to control devices with electroencephalographic (EEG) activity from the scalp or with single-neuron activity from within the brain.\"

> In other words, a BCI converts brain signals of the user into outputs which communicates the user's intents without using muscles or peripheral nerves. (2004, p.6)

> Because of this characteristic advantage BCI is mostly applied in assitive technologies for people with severe motor disabilities, paralyzed (or \'locked in\') by Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke or other neuromuscular diseases.

> A BCI can be invasive or non-invasive. Invasive methods make use of skull penetrating technologies which record information from single neuron\'s activity. Non-invasive methods record EEG signals from from the scalp. Although non-invasive methods are less accurate they are also safer than invasive methods.
